# Local Pelican Builds

These instructions are for building the www-site locally on either linux or macOS.

Note that a [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) is also available to build www-site without installing software (other than a container runtime) locally.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or greater
2. Pip
3. CMake

## Installation

1. Download the files from https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-p6/tree/production/modules/pelican_asf/files

  - build-cmark.sh
  - toc.py
  - pelican-gfm/__init__.py
  - pelican-gfm/gfm.py
  - pelican-build.py

  Note that the GitHub repository is private to the ASF, so only ASF committers with an associated GitHub login can access it.
  If you don't have such a login set up, GitHub will respond with status 404 - File not found
  
2. Build cmark-gfm

```bash
bash build-cmark.sh
export LIBCMARKDIR=`pwd`/cmark-gfm-0.28.3.gfm.12/lib
```

3. Clone the website repository to your system

The example below assumes this is in `~/Dewvelopment/www-site`.

4. Twitter Bearer Token

We make use of the Twitter api to retrieve the most recent tweet. A [Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/bearer-tokens)
is added to `~/.authtokens` file.

```
twitter:${BEARER_TOKEN}
```

If the file is not found or the twitter key is missing then the tweet returned is a message to configure the file.
If the Bearer Token is invalid then the API returns a 401 and the build is stopped.

5. Build the website locally from current local commits

```bash
python3 pelican-build.py --sourcetype git --source ~/Development/www-site --sourcebranch main \
 --outputbranch asf-site --project www --theme theme/apache --count 200
 ```

Arguments   | Description
------------|-----------------
 --sourcetype git           | must be `git`
 --source <local_git_repos> | where you checked in your changes
 --sourcebranch <mybranch>  | the branch. eg. main or preview/feature
 --outputbranch <whatever>  | not used in local builds
 --project <project>        | the project code
 --theme theme/apache       | the path to the theme. One level above the templates directory
 --count <min_count>        | to be a successful build the output must have min_count or more html files

5. Sample output

```
