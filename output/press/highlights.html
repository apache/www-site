<p>Brian Behlendorf started collecting patches to be applied to the
last version of the NCSA http server. The Apache Group, consisting of 8
individuals, traded patches on a mailing list set up for the purpose. In
<strong>April of 1995</strong> the first public release of Apache (version 0.6.2)
came out. Apache 1.0 released on <strong>December 1, 1995</strong>, and within a year surpassed
NCSA as the most-used web server.</p>
<h3 id="1999">Highlights: 1999<a class="headerlink" href="#1999" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ASF formally incorporates as a Delaware-based 501(c)(3)
non-profit corporation from The Apache Group on 1 June. Original
directors are: Brian Behlendorf (President), Ken Coar (VP Conferences),
Roy T. Fielding (Chairman), Ben Hyde (VP Apache HTTP Server Project),
Jim Jagielski (Secretary and EVP), Ben Laurie, Sameer Parekh, Randy
Terbush (Treasurer), and Dirk-Willem van Gulik. New Apache Jakarta
and XML Projects join the Apache HTTP Server Project. Board Committees on
ASF Conferences, Licenses, and Security are formed. Discussions
about ASF's role as an Open Source incubator address fostering new
technologies such as Cocoon. The ASF receives numerous industry awards,
including the ACM Software System Award, the Datamation Product of
the Year, and LinuxWorld Editor's Award. ASF is listed in the Industry
Standard's "100 Companies That Matter" and included in the
ServerWatch Hall of Fame.</p>
<h3 id="2000">Highlights: 2000<a class="headerlink" href="#2000" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Perl-Apache Project, as well as Apache PHP, Apache/TCL Project, and Apache
Portable Runtime Project are established. Apache Struts, Batik, FOP,
and Ant undergo "incubation". The ASF draws record attendance at the
second ApacheCon in Orlando (the first-ever conference was held in
San Francisco in 1998), and launches its first European event in London
later that year.</p>
<h3 id="2001">Highlights: 2001<a class="headerlink" href="#2001" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Apache Avalon, Commons, and Jetspeed/Portals undergo "incubation". Work
begins on next version of the Apache License. The fourth ApacheCon
is held in Santa Clara, where the ASF maxim of "Community Over Code" is
widespread and collaborators meet in person for the very first time.
The ASF receives the Internet Service Providers Association's
Internet Industry Awards for "Best Software Supplier" Apache XML's Xalan-Java
1.2.2 is a finalist in the Best Java-XML Application category in the
JavaWorld Editors' Choice Awards.</p>
<h3 id="2002">Highlights: 2002<a class="headerlink" href="#2002" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Participation in The ASF booms; its process for community and collaborative
development becomes known as "the Apache Way". New Board is formed:
Greg Stein elected Chairman, Dirk-Willem van Gulik as President,
Randy Terbush as Treasurer (later replaced that year by Chuck Murko), and Jim
Jagielski as Executive Vice President/Secretary. Apache Jakarta
launches sub-project BSF; the Apache Incubator Project is born: new
projects include Apache Ant, Avalon, DB, Forrest, HC, POI, and TCL.
Apache HTTP Server and Portable Runtime Project Management
Committees are reestablished. New Board Committees on Infrastructure as well as
Fundraising are formed. The ASF participates in the Java Community
Process. The fifth ApacheCon takes place in Las Vegas. The first community-driven
Apache Cocoon GetTogether is held.</p>
<h3 id="2003">Highlights: 2003<a class="headerlink" href="#2003" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>"Web 2.0" comes to the ASF; the Apache Web Services Project is formed.
New projects in the Apache Incubator include Directory, Geronimo, Gump,
James, Logging Services, Maven, Pluto, SpamAssassin, Tapestry, and XML
Beans. Perl-Apache Project is renamed to the Apache Perl Project,
and Cocoon becomes a Top Level Project. The sixth ApacheCon is held in Las
Vegas, featuring an expo exchange with COMDEX. The Apache HTTP
Server wins Best Server Software by Linux Format; Apache Ant wins Software
Development Magazine Jolt Product Excellence and Productivity Award,
the Java Pro Readers' Choice Award for Most Valuable Java Deployment
Technology, as well as the JavaWorld Editors' Choice Award for "Most
Useful Java Community-Developed Technology". JavaWorld also awards
Apache Xerces-J Editors' Choice for "Best Java XML Tool".
SpamAssassin wins the OSDir Editor's Choice Award. The Apache License v.1.2 is
released; all products of the Foundation are required to be
released under the new license.</p>
<h3 id="2004">Highlights: 2004<a class="headerlink" href="#2004" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>ASF Board members are re-elected: Greg Stein as Chairman, Dirk-Willem
van Gulik as President, Chuck Murko as Treasurer, and Jim Jagielski as
Executive Vice President/Secretary. The stable Apache License v.2.0
is released, and the ASF Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is expanded
to accommodate corporate donations. New Apache projects in the
Incubator include Beehive, Excalibur, Forrest, Gump, Hivemind,
iBatis, Lenya, myFaces, Portals, SpamAssassin, Struts, wsrp4J (Portals
sub-project), Xalan, XMLBeans, and XML Graphics. The Apache Commons
project is terminated, as well as the Project Management Committee
for Avalon. A New Public Relations Committee is established, and The ASF
issues a formal response regarding alleged JBoss IP infringement in
Geronimo. The PHP project amicably separates from The ASF, granting
all rights and responsibilities pertaining to its codebases to the PHP
Group. ApacheCon returns to Las Vegas for its seventh conference.
Apache Ant wins the Java Developer's Journal "Editors Choice Award".</p>
<h3 id="2005">Highlights: 2005<a class="headerlink" href="#2005" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ASF continues to be the community of choice to spearhead new
innovations through its Incubator. Numerous projects in development
