Current documents and status:

    o cla-corporate.txt
      Ratified by ASF June 2004 board meeting, but issues were raised

      out of /proposed/.

    o ccla.txt (.doc, .pdf)
      Copies of cla-corporate.txt, in text, MS Word, and Adobe Acrobat
      formats.  Named 'ccla' to match the individual CLA form in

    o ccla-with-grant.txt
      A version of cla-corporate.txt which incorporates the
      as-yet-unratified changes suggested at the July 2004 board
      meeting, plus language permitting it to also function as a
      software grant (ref. Derby grant).

    o community.txt
      ?

    o software-grant.txt
      Form for contributing chunks of software to the ASF.  Compatible
