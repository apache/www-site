NOTE: This method has been replaced by the process documented at https://apachecon.com/event-images/

Apache websites SHOULD include images so that the ConCom or PRC can advertise
Community Over Code, Apache Roadshows, or other events.

The method that used to be documented here has been deprecated. It
will probably keep working, but as nobody is maintaining it, it will
probably continue to point to older events. Please use the new method,
documented at https://apachecon.com/event-images/
