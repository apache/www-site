the members shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or any
other place (within or outside the State of Delaware and within or outside
the United States) designated in the notice of the meeting.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.2" name="3.2">Section 3.2.</a>Annual Meeting.</strong> A meeting of the
members shall be held annually at such time as the Board of Directors may
determine (which shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not
more than thirteen (13) months after the organization of the corporation
and, in the case of all other meetings, not more than thirteen (13) months
after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting the
members shall elect a Board of Directors and transact other proper
business.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.3" name="3.3">Section 3.3.</a>Special Meetings.</strong> Special
meetings of the members shall be held when directed by the Board Chair,
President or the Board of Directors, or when requested in writing by not
less than ten percent (10%) of all members entitled to vote at the meeting.
The call for the meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the
Board Chair, President, Board of Directors or members requesting the meeting
shall designate another person to do so.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.4" name="3.4">Section 3.4.</a>Notice.</strong> Written notice stating
the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the
date of the meeting, either personally or by first class mail, by or at the
direction of the Board Chair, President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote at
such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail addressed to the member at their
address as it appears in the membership records of the corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the corporation shall not be required
to give notice of a members' meeting to any member to whom notice of two
consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the taking
of action by written consent without a meeting to such member during the
period between such two consecutive annual meetings, have been mailed under
the procedures outlined above and have been returned undeliverable. Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such
member shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly
given. If any such member delivers to the corporation a written notice
setting forth their then current address, the requirement that notice
be given to such member shall be reinstated.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.5" name="3.5">Section 3.5.</a>Notice of Adjourned Meetings.</strong>
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, the corporation shall
not be required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any business may
be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If,
however, the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the
adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as
provided in Section 3.4 above, to each member of record on the new record
date entitled to vote at such meeting.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.6" name="3.6">Section 3.6.</a>Waiver of Notice.</strong> Whenever
notice is required to be given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing,
signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of
such notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any
regular or special meeting of the members need be specified in the written
waiver of notice.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.7" name="3.7">Section 3.7.</a>Fixing Record Date.</strong></p>
<p>(a) For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor
less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining members
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is
given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of members
of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of determining the members entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may
fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors,
and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If
no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date
for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery
to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the
books in which proceedings of meetings of members are recorded. Delivery
made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors
is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the
record date for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.</p>
<p>(c) For purposes of determining the members entitled to exercise any
rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no
record date is fixed, the record date for determining members for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.8" name="3.8">Section 3.8.</a>Record of Members Having Voting
Rights.</strong> The officer or agent having charge of the membership records of
the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before each
meeting of members, a complete list of the members entitled to vote at such
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the name, address,

suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that they are not entitled under applicable law
to be indemnified by the corporation.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.3" name="12.3">Section 12.3.</a>Right of Claimant to Bring
Suit.</strong> If a claim under this Article is not paid in full by the
corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received
by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation unless such action is based on the claimant having committed an
act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct which make indemnification permissible under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because they have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard
of conduct.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.4" name="12.4">Section 12.4.</a>Contract Rights.</strong> The
provisions of this Article shall be a contract between the corporation and
each director, officer or member to which this Article applies. No repeal
or modification of these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any right
or obligation with respect to any state of facts existing prior to the time
of such repeal or modification.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.5" name="12.5">Section 12.5.</a>Rights Non-exclusive.</strong> The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant
to this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled
under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested directors or
otherwise, both as to action in their official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.6" name="12.6">Section 12.6.</a>Insurance.</strong> The corporation
may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a
director, officer, member, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against them and
incurred by them in any such capacity, or arising out of their
status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to
indemnify them against such liability under the provisions of this
Article or of applicable law.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.7" name="12.7">Section 12.7.</a>Definitions.</strong> For purposes of
this Article, references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to
the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
shall stand in the same position under this Article with respect to the
resulting or surviving corporation as they would have with respect to
such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued, and
references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at
the request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries;
and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably
believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an
employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this
Article.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.8" name="12.8">Section 12.8.</a>Continued Coverage.</strong> The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to this Article shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director,
officer or member and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such person.</p>

directors and/or members may be executed in any number of counterparts with
