<p><em>Caution: this is a simplified text to help people understand the legal document. This is NOT the legal Bylaws of The Apache Software Foundation (the ASF). Please consult the <a href="bylaws.html">official text</a> if you intend to base some action or argument on the precise text of the bylaws. Note, also, that the bylaws are interpreted in light of the laws of the State of Delaware in the United States, and that such interpretaion can get complex.</em></p>
<p><em>This summary is of the bylaws as of April, 2022</em></p>
<h2 id="article-1-business-offices">Article 1 - Business offices<a class="headerlink" href="#article-1-business-offices" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Board of Directors (the Board) can put the business offices of the ASF anywhere it wants. In 2022, the official office is in Wilmington, Delaware. (This is just the service address for the ASF; there is no actual "office" and no ASF staff work there.)</p>
<h2 id="article-2-registered-offices-and-agents">Article 2 - Registered offices and agents<a class="headerlink" href="#article-2-registered-offices-and-agents" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="21-delaware">2.1 Delaware<a class="headerlink" href="#21-delaware" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Certificate of Incorporation of the ASF states the location of the first office of the ASF, which was in the State of Delaware, and the name of the first registered agent of the ASF. Whenever the Board changes either the office location or its registered agents, it must inform the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.</p>
<h3 id="22-other-states">2.2 Other states<a class="headerlink" href="#22-other-states" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If the ASF needs to set up offices or have registered agents in other states, it must follow the laws and rules of those states. (Note: this probably applies to any nation on earth, not just states in the United States of America.)</p>
<h2 id="article-3-members-meetings">Article 3 - Members' meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#article-3-members-meetings" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="31-meeting-place">3.1 Meeting place<a class="headerlink" href="#31-meeting-place" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Official meetings of Members of the ASF can take place anywhere. Historically, meetings have taken place in person (in the early years), or on Internet Relay Chat (IRC).</p>
<h3 id="32-annual-meeting">3.2 Annual meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#32-annual-meeting" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Board must call an annual meeting of the Members of the ASF within 13 months of the previous annual meeting. At an annual meeting the Members elect the Board and carry out any other "proper" business. (There is no definition of "proper".)</p>
<h3 id="33-special-meetings">3.3 Special meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#33-special-meetings" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Board Chair, the President, the full Board, or 10%+1 of the Members who can vote can call a special meeting at any time. The person or group calling the meeting can assign the person to announce it.</p>
<h3 id="34-notice-of-members-meetings">3.4 Notice of Members' meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#34-notice-of-members-meetings" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The person or group calling the meeting, or the person they assign, must inform Members of the meeting at least 10 days before, and not more than 60 days before, the day of the meeting. The notice must be given "personally" or by first class mail to the mailing address the ASF has for each Member. ("Personally" is not defined, but is currently satisfied by sending email to a deliberately low-volume email list, <a href="mailto:members-notify@apache.org">members-notify@apache.org</a> which is auto-subscribed by each Member.)</p>
<p>The ASF is not responsible for informing Members of meetings if it no longer has a good address or other contact information for them, based on two notices of Members' meetings in a row being undeliverable. It is up to each Member to keep their contact information current with the ASF.</p>
<h3 id="35-notice-of-adjourned-members-meetings">3.5 Notice of adjourned Members' meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#35-notice-of-adjourned-members-meetings" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The ASF does not have to send out notices if a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if the new time and place were announced in the course of the meeting <strong>unless</strong> the date changes by more than thirty (30) days. Then section 3.4 applies.</p>
<h3 id="36-waiver-of-notice">3.6 Waiver of notice<a class="headerlink" href="#36-waiver-of-notice" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Any Member can tell the ASF in writing that they don't need a formal notice of Members' meetings. If you attend a meeting you can't require a notice of that meeting <strong>except</strong> if you intend to object that the meeting is out of order.</p>
<h3 id="37-setting-the-record-date-for-the-meeting">3.7 Setting the record date for the meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#37-setting-the-record-date-for-the-meeting" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>a. The Board can set a "record date", between 10 and 60 days before a Members' meeting. Those who are ASF Members on the record date are Members who must be invited to, and may take part in, the coming meeting. If the Board does not set a record date, the day two days before when the notice of meeting is sent to Members (OR, if there is no notice for the meeting, two days before the meeting date) is the record date.</p>
<p>b. When the Board wants to know what the Members want to do about something without holding a meeting (see section 3.12), it can set a "record date", as above, to determine the Members who can express their wishes about the matter in writing.</p>
<p>c. The Board can establish a "record date" as in item a. to establish which Members can exercise rights or take some other action. The record date cannot be more than 60 days before the time when the Members might want to exercise those rights.</p>
<h3 id="38-voting-rights">3.8 Voting rights<a class="headerlink" href="#38-voting-rights" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Secretary or other person the Board assigns makes a list of Members entitled to vote at a meeting, ten days before the meeting. The list is private, but any Member can ask for a copy to review for accuracy. If the Directors of the ASF do not produce such a list for a meeting that involves the election of Members, those Directors are not eligible to be elected to any office at that meeting.</p>
<h3 id="39-quorum">3.9 Quorum<a class="headerlink" href="#39-quorum" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Normally, the quorum for an ASF Members' meeting is one-third (33% +1) of the Members eligible to vote at that meeting. Having a quorum means the meeting can legally conduct business, including the election of Board members.</p>
<p>(There are details about different classes of membership that are not relevant right now to the ASF.)</p>
<p>Candidates for the Board are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This is currently implemented via the Single Transferrable Vote method in which Members vote for their first, second, third, etc. choice.</p>
<p>Members can assign another Member to be their proxy, so that member can act on their behalf. All proxies also count toward establishing the quorum. (See below.)</p>
<p>If Members leave the meeting after the quorum for the meeting has been established, the quorum is still valid for the duration of the meeting.</p>
<p>If actions during the meeting result in adding Members to the ASF, the meeting's already-established quorum is still valid.</p>
<h3 id="310-voting">3.10 Voting<a class="headerlink" href="#310-voting" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each Member (not Emeritus Members) has one vote on each matter submitted for a vote during the meeting. Members can vote themselves or by having a proxy cast their vote.</p>
<h3 id="311-proxies">3.11 Proxies<a class="headerlink" href="#311-proxies" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A proxy is a person to whom you give authority to act for you, especially in regard to quorum or voting. The use here specifically relates to ASF Members giving another Member the right to register as "present" for them for the purpose of establishing a quorum and to vote on their behalf in Members' meetings.</p>
<p>The Member or someone with legal authority to act for them must "sign" the proxy form. In practice, the ASF recognizes digital signatures through an online process.</p>
<p>The proxy is valid for three years from the date it is given, unless the proxy form includes a shorter time limit. You can revoke a proxy you have given.</p>
<h3 id="312-members-taking-action-without-a-meeting">3.12 Members taking action without a meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#312-members-taking-action-without-a-meeting" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Anything that can happen at a Members' meeting, can happen without a meeting <strong>if</strong> enough members have signed written consents for the action. "Enough" in this case would be the minimum number of votes that would authorize taking the action at a meeting at which all voting Members were present. Each consent must have a Member's signature. Members must deliver their consents to the ASF within 60 days of the ASF receiving the first one.</p>
<p>The ASF must notify all Members promptly of an action it takes in this way.</p>

A member can, at the start of the meeting, object to its transacting any business if the member argues that the meeting was called or convened improperly. (The bylaws do not say what happens then.)</p>
