<p>Each Project Management Committee (PMC) votes on its software product releases
and elects new PMC members and committers to its Apache project.</p>
<p>The PMCs are the most important organizations at the ASF. These are the actual groups that decide what
software our projects release, and do the bulk of the actual work of the ASF.</p>
<p>This document is background information about how and why organizations at the ASF work they way they do.  For
official policy information and "How To" style guides, please the
documents under References or in <a href="/dev/">/dev</a>.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#organization" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Committers elected to the PMC within a specific Apache project provide oversight
for the project on behalf of the ASF, deciding the release strategy for the project.
PMC members are expected to act as individuals, making decisions for the best
interest of the project when acting on PMC or development lists.</p>
<p>Each project's PMC is independent. PMCs are free to set community and technical
direction for their project, and are directly responsible for overseeing
releases and the healthy development of their communities. PMCs are responsible
for ensuring their project follows certain core requirements set by the board
or other corporate officers of the ASF, like following Legal-, Branding-, and
Infrastructure-related requirements, and ensuring their community
operates within the basic outline of the Apache Way.</p>
<p>PMC members nominate new contributors to the project as either committers or
as PMC members, and vote whether to elect elect new committers or
PMC members. <a href="/dev/pmc.html#faq">PMC members also have binding votes on any project matters</a>.</p>
<p>PMCs must have at least three (3) active members. This is because
the minimum number of positive (+1) votes required for a product release is <a href="/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval">three</a>.</p>
<h2 id="legal">Legal<a class="headerlink" href="#legal" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The board creates PMCs to manage specific named projects by resolution at
monthly meetings. New top level projects (TLPs) are created from podlings in
the Apache Incubator after a successful graduation vote from Incubation. The
board appoints a Vice President - an officer of the corporation - to serve as
the chair of the project's PMC.</p>
<p>PMC Chairs serve as normal PMC members, with one vote on
project matters just like other PMC members. The primary duty of a PMC chair
is providing quarterly reports to the board about the health and status of
their project. PMC chairs are expected to subscribe to the board@ mailing list,
and to be aware of any board concerns about the project, and are responsible for
working with the PMC as a whole to address any board concerns.</p>
<p>When PMCs elect new potential PMC members, the chair
of a project sends a NOTICE e-mail to the board.  Assuming that the candidate
accepts the offer of membership, the PMC chair may update the official roster
of the members of that PMC. The process is designed to ensure that the board
has explicit notification of all PMC changes.</p>
<p>For more details on the process, read <a href="/dev/pmc.html#newpmc">Adding a new PMC member</a></p>
<p>For people leaving the PMC, read <a href="/dev/pmc.html#emeritus">A PMC member wishes to be resign/go emeritus. Now what?</a></p>
<p>Changes in PMC
<strong>chairs</strong> require board resolutions to be approved at monthly meetings, since this
involves appointment of an officer of the ASF. Follow the <a href="/dev/pmc.html#newchair">PMC Chair Change process</a>.</p>
<p>As official committees of the ASF, PMCs provide legal oversight of project
operations and releases, ensuring that software releases take place on behalf of
. This helps ensure that the ASF as an organization, not individual committers, bears any legal liability for the products of Apache projects. All PMC chairs provide <a href="/foundation/board/reporting">quarterly reports to
the board</a>, which ensures that the board has oversight of all ASF projects.</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>All PMC members should subscribe to their project's private@ list, and
certainly should subscribe to at least the dev@ list to be aware of the
operations of the project.</p>
<p>Virtually all PMC communication should happen on the dev@ list or any other
appropriate public mailing list. The private@ list for each PMC is for matters that require confidentiality, such as discussing personnel
matters, whether to invite new committers or PMC members, or security-related issues
that have not yet been publicly disclosed. Ensuring that PMC discussions about
the future of the project take place the public dev@ list ensures that all of
the community, including non-committers, can follow the discussion and
comment on issues. While only PMC members or committers have binding votes on
project matters, healthy PMCs work actively with the larger community of their
project.</p>
<p>PMCs are free to use JIRA/Bugzilla, wikis, and other Infrastructure-hosted
tools that provide for public view and comment, along with the normal project
mailing lists. PMCs should make specific requests to the Infrastructure team
for services that the project desires.</p>
<h2 id="meetings">Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#meetings" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some PMCs sponsor in-person meetings, teleconferences,
or IRC chats to brainstorm project ideas, but must bring all
information back to their project's public lists for further discussion and to make final
decisions. Many PMCs either directly organize, or have contributors or
organizations in their technical space organize, Meetups, BarCamps, or other
in-person events focused on end-user education and sharing technical information.</p>
<p>Given the distributed and volunteer nature of our projects, in-person meetings
of PMCs are quite rare. All project business takes place on the project's normal public
mailing lists.</p>
<h2 id="merit">Merit<a class="headerlink" href="#merit" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>PMCs are free to set the bar for merit within their projects, as long as
decision-making takes place in a collaborative fashion as in the Apache Way.
Healthy PMCs regularly review contributions from non-committers - specific code patches, bugs reported or commented on, or just helpful
interaction on their project lists - to evaluate contributors as potential
committers. Ensuring that PMC members are mentoring helpful new
contributors to their projects strengthens the project
community.</p>
<p>PMCs vary significantly in the level of commitment and work they expect for a contributor to be
considered for committership or membership in the PMC. Some PMCs vote in new PMC members from their existing committers (i.e. the progression is contributor -&gt; vote
-&gt; committer -&gt; vote -&gt; PMC), while other PMCs always elect new committers
into the PMC simultaneously (contributor -&gt; vote -&gt; committer &amp; PMC member).
PMCs are solely responsible for managing votes and granting commit privileges
for new committers; however the board must recognize newly-elected PMC members before they officially become part of the PMC (as described in the
<a href="#legal">Legal</a> section above).</p>
<p>Merit within one PMC is not transferable to other PMCs; each project's PMC manages the project's
committer list independently. PMC members or
committers with a long history on one project will often be known by their
past activities by other project's PMC members, but they are expected to
build merit on each separate project they wish to become a committer on.
There are many PMCs that work closely with other PMCs, and have
correspondingly-large intersection in personnel; but the merit on each PMC
is independent.</p>
<p>Although the plain sense of the word "committer" is "someone who can create new
revisions in the source repository", the notion of committership is a social
one: someone is a committer if the PMC has invited them to be a
committer, and they have accepted the invitation.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community<a class="headerlink" href="#community" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>While only PMC members have binding votes on project releases, in general PMC
members participate equally with their project committers and contributors on the dev@ list.
PMC members can help develop a healthy and diverse project community by
ensuring the project's mailing lists are welcoming to newcomers and that members promote and follow
community standards on its mailing lists.</p>
<p>While there are many projects with overlapping communities, and therefore
some shared personal or technical relationships, fundamentally each project
is its own community in terms of the bulk of project work. While all projects
are part of the overall ASF, and share certain basic requirements and
bits of the Apache Way, all technical direction and most of the community focus
is within each individual project.</p>
<p>PMCs report on the health and diversity of their project's
community to the board. While there are no strict requirements on the makeup
of PMC members (in terms of employment or affiliation of the individuals on
the PMC), the board does expect PMCs to operate independently of outside
commercial influence. The board will contact PMCs that are unable or unwilling to ensure their
actions are on behalf of the whole community, or that act in ways targeted to benefit
specific commercial interest, and will require them to make corrections.</p>
<h2 id="technical">Technical<a class="headerlink" href="#technical" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The board does not provide technical direction for any of its projects or
activities. PMCs are the governing body for their project, and are expected to manage the
project's technology in the best interest of the whole project community,
independently of outside commercial influence.</p>
<p>While this may be a surprise to some, it is a key reflection of how the ASF
is intentionally structured to ensure maximum freedom to its projects. The
board and the ASF are happy to provide a home to any software project
communities that are willing to follow the Apache Way. The mission of the ASF
is to provide software for the common good. We are happy to help like-minded
communities provide that software, are confident that communities will form
around software that is useful, and understand that there are many different
ways to effectively and collaboratively build software.</p>
