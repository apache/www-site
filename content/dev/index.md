## Overview {#intro}

Here are resources pertinent to developers, committers, release managers and Project Management Committee (PMC) members contributing to any Apache project.

If you can't find information here, ask on your project's mailing list, or contact the [Community Development](http://community.apache.org/) project's mailing list for more general questions. There are many experienced ASF people ready to help.

## Apache Infrastructure  {#infrastructure}

Here are links to high-level information about The ASF's infrastructure, and the Infrastructure team (Infra) that maintains it.

## Issue and Bug Tracking  {#issues}

Each project uses an <a href="https://issues.apache.org/" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> of their choice to 
track bugs, enhancement requests, and other action items - typically GitHub Issues, Jira, or BugZilla.
Check the <a href="http://projects.apache.org/indexes/quick.html" target="_blank">website of the project in which you are interestaed to learn what they use.

## Mailing Lists  {#mail}

- Please read the [Public Forum Archive Policy](/foundation/public-archives.html) before posting on any Apache mailing list!
- [Subscription instructions and netiquette](/foundation/mailinglists.html) for all Apache mailing lists.
- All Apache projects have their own [set of project-specific mailing lists](http://projects.apache.org/indexes/quick.html).
- There are [some other non-project](/foundation/mailinglists.html) mailing lists, such as `legal-discuss@`, `community@` and various announcement lists.
-  [Privacy notes](/foundation/mailinglists.html) about non-public lists and about [balancing confidentiality and public discussion](/foundation/how-it-works.html#confidential).
-  [Email etiquette tips for contributors](contrib-email-tips) 
-  How to [moderate Apache mailing lists](committers.html#mail-moderate) 
-  All Apache mailing lists are archived:
    - Read most Apache [list archives on mail-archives.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/) by going to the specific project list, then append the mbox filename to the URL (e.g. [mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201210.mbox](mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-dev/201210.mbox))
    - Raw mbox archive files are available for every mailing list.
    - Each project website has a "mail" directory, e.g. [httpd.apache.org/mail/](http://httpd.apache.org/mail/)
(see [notes](/dev/project-site.html#mail)).
    - For top-level/non-project mailing lists see [www.apache.org/mail/](/mail/) directory.

## Pasting data to share with others  {#paste}

Apache provides a paste bin service for committers to use at [https://paste.apache.org](https://paste.apache.org).

Anyone can view the pastes (except those marked 'committers only'), but only committers are allowed to paste new data on the site.

## Apache URL Shortener Service  {#shorten}

Infrastructure hosts the [s.apache.org URL shortening service](https://s.apache.org/) for our committers.  When including URLs in PMC reports, please use this service and not other URL shorteners.
