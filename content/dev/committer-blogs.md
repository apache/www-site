Planet Apache aggregates personal blogs from Apache committers.
Apache also [hosts official project blogs](project-blogs) for top level
projects or incubator podlings that request them.

# Apache Committer personal blogs  {#personal-blogs}

We encourage committers with personal blogs to add their feed to
[planet.apache.org](https://planet.apache.org) for aggregation. To get your
personal blog listed and aggregated:

  - Check out the [planet module](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/) from our SVN repo.
  - Edit the config.ini file to add your blog's information. See the README and FAQ files for details.
  - Commit the changed file.

```
:::shell
 $ svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/
 ```
    
Read these committer blogs at [Planet Apache](https://planet.apache.org/committers/).
Many committers submit their technology-related blogs, but some committers 
also blog on personal matters.
