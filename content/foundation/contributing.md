  <h1 class="text-center">Support Apache: Individual Giving and Sponsorship Programs</h1>
  <p class="lead">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is the world’s largest Open Source software foundation. It provides $20B+ worth of software for the public good at no cost.</p>
  <p>As a <a href="/foundation/records/ASF-501c3.pdf">US 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization</a>, the ASF depends on a variety of funding sources to sustain its day-to-day activities. Your support enables the all-volunteer ASF to ensure its 350+ <a href="https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?category">community-driven software projects</a> remain freely available to billions of users around the world, and to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubate</a> the next generation of Open Source innovations.</p>
  <p>Tax-deductible contributions from corporations, foundations, and private individuals help offset day-to-day operating expenses that include Infrastructure services; Marketing and PR/AR; and Legal, Accounting, and Operational support.</p>
  <p>We spend less than 10% of our annual budget on overhead. 75% of the ASF's US$1.5MM annual budget supports running our critical infrastructure (mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, Web servers, continuous integration servers, bandwidth, electricity, cooling, administrative staff, and more) that keeps the Foundation and its projects functioning 24x7x365. The annual cost is less than US$5K per project.</p>
  <p>We are proud to highlight the ASF's diverse accomplishments in our <a href="/foundation/reports.html">Annual Report</a>. Many of these successes were made possible by your support.</p>
  <h2>Support the ASF today!</h2>
  <p>There are many ways to support the ASF, with giving options for individuals and organizations alike. We thank all current ASF supporters and Sponsors for their loyalty and contributions, and look forward to welcoming new donors as we continue to expand our community.</p>
  <p>For those based in the US, donations are 100% tax deductible to the full extent of the law. As regulations vary, we encourage you to consult a qualified advisor experienced with your local tax law pertaining to donations. The ASF's tax identification number is 47-0825376. More information about non-profits and related issues can be found at the <a href="http://www.nonprofits.org/" target="_blank">Internet Nonprofit Center</a>.</p>
  <p>The ASF is recognized by <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&ein=470825376" target="_blank">Charity Navigator</a> and cited with the Gold Seal of Transparency by <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/profile/47-0825376" target="_blank">GuideStar</a>.
