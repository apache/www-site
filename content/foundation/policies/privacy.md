## Privacy Policy

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is an open source project organized under the auspices of a public benefit corporation. Our challenges and goals are large. For that reason, we have a very permissive privacy policy that mirrors our public mission.

Please assume that everything you contribute intentionally to The ASF, or to any project at The ASF, is public. This includes emails on public lists, wiki page edits, online discussions of all sorts, and software or documentation that you post to this website or to our revision control repositories.

We follow an academic model that expects mutual personal respect, disclosure of interests and openness of expression is public information. There may be cases when you are invited to share private information for various purposes, and denote that information as such. In those cases, we commit to only disclosing that information without your permission upon receipt of a valid subpoena and following notice from The ASF to you.

Although what you disclose here is public, we are all limited by copyright and patent law in how we may use your contributions. Therefore, The ASF only accepts voluntary contributions of software and documentation that are expressly licensed to The ASF under an approved open-source license.
