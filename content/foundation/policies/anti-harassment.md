## Policy Information
**Please see the [Apache-wide Code of Conduct policy](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct), which covers expected 
behavior within any Apache project's public or private spaces, including email lists.**

The Apache Conference Committee adopted this policy. Its most recent change was on 2011-08-24.

## Applicability

All conferences organised directly by the Apache Software Foundation are required
to have an Anti-Harassment Policy. Unless otherwise approved by ConCom, these events will use the policy listed below.

All conferences organised by an external producer on behalf of the Apache Software Foundation (such as ApacheCon)
must have an Anti-Harassment Policy. We recommend that you use the policy below, but you may use an alternative policy if
the ConCom planners approve it. Such approval will only be granted provided that the policy provides
similar coverage, and you supply an explanation for the change.

Conferences organised by third parties which use Apache marks (under the 
[Third Party Event Branding Policy](/foundation/marks/events.html)) must have an Anti-Harassment
Policy. The policy must either be the one below or one approved as an alternative by the ASF.

### Full version (the one posted at [URL])
[Event name] is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without
a refund, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop
any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated in any event
venue, including talks. Exhibitors should also refrain from using
sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff
(including volunteers) should not use sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised
environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
or expulsion from the event without a refund. We expect participants
to follow these rules at all event venues and related social events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event team
immediately. The team can be found [registration desk location or similar].

The event team will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security (as available) or local law enforcement, provide escorts to walk
you to/from your room/car/taxi/etc, or otherwise assist those experiencing 
harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
