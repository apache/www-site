 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The main topic of discussion for the board this month has been the
       possible need for additional staffing, and what that role should look
       like.  This has considered everything from an infrastructure lead to a
       "general manager" role, and continues from the topics raised in Ross'
       report last month, as well as the Infrastructure Lead discussion item
       in February. At this point, no action has been taken.

       Thanks to everyone involved in publishing our second annual report
       earlier in the month. It looks great, and did pick up some positive
       attention.

    B. President [Ross]

       Once again I must apologize for the very late posting of this
       report. I will provide a full verbal report as it is unlikely
       all Directors will have had the time to absorb the contents
       here. The good news is that the personal issues keeping me from
       work like this are very definitely subsiding. Expect me back up
       to speed in the coming weeks.

       Executive Assistance

       Business as usual. No unexpected activities.

       Brand Management

       VP Brand reports an increase in the number of PMC members
       actively monitoring trademark usage. This has resulted in an
       increase in the number of concerns raised, in most cases only
       when they are significant issues rather than early diversions
       from policy. This highlights what is needed next in terms of
       the education of our PMCs in managing brand: "Since branding
       issues are not as clear cut as compiler errors, this often
       results in an imprecise call to action that is sometimes taken
       in the wrong spirit by the receiving PMC, resulting in a lot of
       unfortunate noise and anger." This months report from VP Brand
       contains a number of specific recommendations for our
       communities. I encourage everyone to read them and communicate
       them within their projects.

       Fundraising

       Hadrian has raised some concerns about a small increase in the
       number of Bronze sponsors that he is uncomfortable with, he is
       of the opinion that they are seeking advertising rather than
       supporting the foundation. He attributes this to a relaxing of
       the "no-follow" policy. This was relaxed some time ago but only
       recently documented on the fundraising website
       website. The timing makes it unclear if the removal of
       no-follow is related to these two new sponsors and since both
       sponsors likely depend on ASF technologies and are (it appears)
       legitimate businesses I am taking no position on this other
       than to remind VPs Fundraising that they are free to define
       policy as they see fit.

       Another area that needs clarification is "in-kind" donations,
       in particular for infra. This conversation is on-going.

       Marketing and Publicity

       Our annual report was published on time. A big thank you to
       Sally for coordinating and to all contributors. I am pleased to
       say I only wrote one report this time around (my own) and thus
       the whole process was much more enjoyable for myself. I have
       reminded VPs Fundraising to ensure that this needs to be sent
       out to sponsors, but I can report my own employer was pleased
       to see the details laid out clearly. I am confident that this
       will make renewal conversations easier over the coming year.

       Sally's report contains the usual "business as usual" facts and
       figures about our ongoing M&P work.

       Infrastructure

       The search continues to find new staff. Unfortunately the only
       candidates found so far are cost prohibitive (that I know of
       wither David or I have spoken to 7 potential candidates). Infra
       continue to raise concerns, with justification. We are
       broadening the search through broader job advertising sites and
       would welcome any referrals from the broader community. I can
       provide a job description on request.

       There is also a concern about the growth of the foundation and
       what it means to infra resourcing. For example: "Given our
       current rate of growth, addressing tickets alone will require
       5.5 full time staff members by years end, and if we continue at
       our current pace we'll need to add 1 to 1.5 staff members every
       2 years just to deal with continued growth." This does not
       include "big ticket items" such as Git support. The infra
       report includes more details and data.

       This issue will have my full attention over the coming year. We
       are not at risk today, but financial this model breaks in 4-5
       years if we do not either increase fundraising or decrease
       demands on infra. The solution is to do both increase
       fundraising and reduce demand (both through removal of
       unnecessary work and enabling more self-service).

       There have been some outages around Nexus. There is a medium
       term plan to move this to a more reliable and maintainable
       infrastructure. In the meantime the team continue to use sticky
       plasters where necessary.

       David has started renegotiating contracts with existing
       employees/contractors as per my 1:1 with each at ApacheCon.

       As a result of understaffing we did not meet this months SLA
       for repository.a.o (see above). Overall we met SLA on the three
       categories of critical, core and standard services. Given the
       staffing circumstances this is understandable and I support the
       teams prioritization efforts.

       Travel Assistance Committee

       No report submitted at the time of writing. However, EA has
       reported that the TAC recipient surveys are complete with
       responses being prepared for publication. We are close to
       closing out the budget for TAC this time around. With the
       recent announcement of the opening of EU CFP TAC are now
       planning their timetable to support that event.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       In May, 71 iclas, four cclas, and three grants were received and

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       Registration and CFPs are up for ApacheCon Seville, and Apache
       Big Data Seville, at http://apachecon.com/ but this hasn't been
       widely announced. We'll be starting to promote that in the
       coming week or two, as soon I have some time. Meanwhile, LF is
       promoting the events via their websites.

       Audio from ApacheCon Vancouver is slowly making it up to
       Feathercast.org. I think at this point all of the audio has
       been processed and uploaded. I just need to do the actual
       podcast posts via Wordpress to publish them.

       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Craig proposes that the board appoint Sam Ruby to the position of
    Assistant Secretary.

    The board appoints Sam Ruby to the office of Assistant Secretary.

    B. Jim wishes to discuss the OSI Affiliate program

    Jim: a few years back, Jim was on the OSI board; ASF thought it
    might make sense to join OSI but didn't match OSI who were trying to
    establish themselves. OSI is now trying to refocus on community
    aspects and now sees affiliates as helping.

    Jim volunteers to continue discussion with OSI.

    Chris: ok

    Marvin: will we have to opt out or opt in to OSI decisions?

    Jim: OSI will notify affiliates before taking action affecting them.
    In fact, ASF can help redefine affiliate interaction

    Mark: will OSI expect affiliates to pay dues?

    Jim: no dues for affiliates.

    Mark: what are benefits to ASF?

    Jim: gives ASF more opportunity to promote The Apache Way; up to now
    projects might not be steered to ASF

    @Jim: continue to work with OSI and report to the board next month

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

# Operations

A number of project-related discussions spilled across trademarks@ this past
month, with complaints about either vendor use of project brands or PMC
handling of the situations; Spark and Cassandra both were major sources of
discussion and action by members, the PMCs, and the board.

The good news is that this shows a wider variety of individuals are looking at
and raising issues that affect how our project brands and the Apache brand are
used (or mis-used).  We've long needed to have more Members and project
contributors looking for and bringing up these issues.

The not as good news is the way that these issues have been raised, as well as
in some cases how the PMC has responded.  The trouble with branding mis-uses
is that many project participants don't pay attention until they happen to see
something that REALLY UPSETS THEM!  Thus we historically have plenty of times
with no reports, and then suddenly a project contributor or ASF Member RAISES
THIS HUGE ISSUE THAT MUST BE DEALT WITH.  Since branding issues are not as
clear cut as compiler errors, this often results in an imprecise call to
action that is sometimes taken in the wrong spirit by the receiving PMC,
resulting in a lot of unfortunate noise and anger.

Separately, one PMC did not appear to take recent complaints seriously enough,
to the point where the board required a new project report and discussed some
very serious potential future consequences.  This not as good news calls for
better behavior in three kinds of situations:

1- If you see an Apache project branding mis-use, say something - in a polite,
specific, and actionable way.  We have guides for this.  Branding issues need
to be as specific as possible, to ensure we can request concrete steps by the
mis-user to correct them.  In particular, assuming ignorance rather than
malice, and raising issues in a positive way really help to reduce
miscommunications and arguments about details.

http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/reporting

2- It's clear that not all PMCs fully understand and/or regularly pay
attention to their project's branding issues.  Detailed procedures exist, but
ensuring that PMCs are truly taking things like Project Independence to heart
in their day to day actions - as well as in the public uses of their brand by
vendors in the ecosystem - is something we still need to work on.  Branding
issues are far easier to solve the earlier they are reported, and PMCs need to
fully ensure the appearance of independent governance for their projects:

http://community.apache.org/projectIndependence

3- While we are a volunteer-led organization that allows individual project
participants broad responsibility and ability to direct their own project's
affairs, we are still a single Foundation with documented governance and
required policies.  It should not take a director bringing up serious
consequences to a PMC to have the PMC take credible reports of brand mis-uses
seriously, and to take positive action on specific issues immediately.

# Registrations

After some great progress on a few legal related issues, several new issues
have come up and some past ones seem stalled.  It's clear I'll need to work on
more time as VP to keep the legal & application process side of the house on
track.  This needs more investigation to see if it's related to our current
counsel billing process and budget. 

OFBIZ is now our registered trademark in the US.  We have applied for US
registrations for TEZ and FLINK.  Several other projects have expressed
interest in US registrations, including one or two logo registrations.

# Organizational Note

For the record, I have been laid off from my employer, and am now formally
unaffiliated.  This does not change my view on the VP, Brand Management
position, which has always been that the good of the Foundation as a whole
comes first.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

During the past few weeks we got a number of Bronze sponsors that, while I am
sure rely on ASF technologies for their operations, seem to be not very well
aligned with ASF's mission (this is not an allegation, just my personal
opinion). The concern, expressed on the mailing list is that such sponsors
seem more interested in marketing related benefits.

Another item that generated a bit of a debate on the Fundraising@ mailing list
is related to a discussion I had with a cloud provider to offer an in-kind
sponsorship that seems to be not very well received by infra@. While I will
have to clarify with infra@ and its VP what exactly is we do and do not need,
I started a more general thread on Fundraising@ to gather ideas and opinions
about the type of services we would need as in-kind sponsorship.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Operations Action Items:
========================
Hiring
--------
We've published a job description and are working with the President
and Virtual to publish this widely in efforts to solicit more candidates.

Demand for Infra services
-----------------------------------

The number of projects that the Foundation is responsible for
continues to grow, and that is placing an ever increasing burden
on demands for infrastructure resources. Today, our largest constraint
is staff members to do the work.

Historically, we've had an average of 33 tickets per month per full
time staff member, and as that average grows we typically add staff.
Today we have 3.5 full time staff members - working, though statically, we
really should be at 5 just to be able to handle the ticket load. (This does not
include any time to focus on larger scale projects)

Given our current rate of growth, addressing tickets alone will require 5.5 full time
staff members by years end, and if we continue at our current pace we'll need to add
1 to 1.5 staff members every 2 years just to deal with continued growth.

Take a look at a graph demonstrating the growrth rates, demand for services
based on tickets, and staff members:
https://i.imgur.com/72V0DFN.png


Short Term Priorities:
======================
TLP
Some of the automation behind the mechanics of transforming a
graduated podling into a TLP fell into disrepair over the past few
months. This led to many exaggerated timelines for TLP graduation.
Infra held a TLP work day and while it largely remains a manual operation
there is now a runbook that is current for dealing with graduations. And
all of the pending graduations were processed. There is ongoing work
to automate large swaths of that, but for now it should only take
~30 minutes to process a newly-graduated TLP.


Long Range Priorities:
======================

Because of staffing shortage, precious little work has occurred on
our long range priorities. Instead we've moved back to what can
largely be described as firefighting and attempting to keep up
with incoming work as best as can be managed.

General Activity:
=================

Outages:
------------

We suffered a somewhat longterm outage of the Nexus repository.
We temporarily restored the service, but a service move off of the
ailing VMW infrastructure is planned for the short term future.

More recently, we suffered both a database and VMware-related
outage on the same day. Our VMware infrastructure is on increasingly
brittle hardware. We have been concerted efforts for some months on moving
VMs off of this infrastructure, and continue to do so.

New Contracts
--------------------
Following up on discussions that occurred at ApacheCon NA, we are beginning the process
of renegotiating contracts for our non-employee staff members.

Uptime Statistics:
==================
Overall we met the service uptime, though on an
individual service basis we did not meet the uptime expectations for repository.a.o.
Please see:
http://status.apache.org/sla/


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]

ACNA 16
-------
Surveys have gone out, and most feedback received. Generally very positive,
a few small suggestions for improvements for next time (especially around
tooling and on-the-ground communications). Interviews for the Past
Recipients site in progress

We still need to finalise costs with the LF before we can be sure on exactly
how much the event cost. (We owe them for some registration fees, they owe
us for some other bits!)

ACEU 16
-------
Disucussions have started on when to close applications based on the CFP
dates

No progress yet on questions, promotion or the extra/tweaked tooling needed

Future
------
Notes from Vancouver meetings still need to finish being written up and
circulated


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

No changes to W3C participation by ASF.

An open letter from the EFF to the W3C Advisory Committee regarding EME
(Encypted Media Extension) generated a lot of discussion. This included
resubmiting the proposal for a covenant to protect implementers and to
make it an exit condition for the EME work proceeding.

The outome so far is a propsal for an advisory "Technology and Policy
Interest Group" (TechPolig). Proceedings will be W3C-member-only. The
initial areas for TechPolig are Deep Linking, DMCA-like challenges and
Surveillance.

W3C background:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Some discussions regarding license compatibility, specifically
related to OpenSSL dependency, and the official release process.

No issues requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Following from the discussion from Mark Thomas at last board mtg we
discussed a plan for handling of security issues that are repeatedly
ignored by a PMC (determined by history of dealing with the PMC/issue
severity/issue history).  We will draft a mail ready to be sent to the
issue reporter which outlines the steps we made to contact the PMC and
our suggested next action (usually that the reporter posts the details
of the issue public in some forum such as the oss-security list).
That draft will be sent to the PMC as our final attempt to get the PMC
to respond and work with the reporter, and after some further period
of inactivity will be sent to the reporter and recorded in the next
board report.

Stats for May 2016:

10 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom Syndication 
Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is in maintenance mode with minimal development activity. I believe 
there are at least three PMC members providing oversight still. Not much 
at all going on in Abdera the last few months other than misfiled JIRA.

The last release was over two years ago, the last commiter / PMC member 
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

## Description:

Apache Bigtop is a software related to a system for integration,
packaging, deployment and validation of a big data management
software distribution based on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:

Issues regarding ODPi's vs. Apache Bigtop position have been resolved
on the private@ mailing list.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing

Issues
======

The board should be aware that the Bloodhound PMC has voted on moving the
project to the attic as discussed below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last additions
in January 2014.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

As discussed in the last report, due to there not being enough active PMC
members with the necessary skills to keep the project going, there has
been discussion of moving the project to the Attic. As such a vote has been
undertaken to make an official decision on this, which was passed with the
following results:

+1: (7) brane, chambej, gjm, matevz, mbooth, rjollos, saintgermain
0: (0)
-1: (0)

A link to the summary email for this is here: https://s.apache.org/qqj0

The resolution to terminate the Apache Bloodhound project has therefore
been added as item D of the Special Orders section of the board agenda for
this month.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

The project released version 3.1.1 (stable branch) to fix bugs, while
continuing development on 4.0 (alpha branch).  Many changes were made to
4.0 the past quarter for the Remote Object Persistence (ROP) layer of
Cayenne to make it more modular and allow swapping serialization protocols.
These changes will continue as ROP and other features are fleshed out for
the 4.0 release.


## Health report:

Cayenne is still under active development and mailing list activity
indicates we have an active and stable community.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Will Stevens]

## Description:
   Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
   orchestration platform.  ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage
   and networking devices.


## Issues:

 - The PMC currently has a Jira ticket open with Infra to have the Github
   mirror `apache/cloudstack` moved to `apachecloudstack/cloudstack`.
 - Once the move described by the above Jira ticket is done, the ACS project
   will be able to better manage the implementation of our CI initiative.


## Activity:

 - We had a slow down in releases in the first half of this year due to not
   having a Release Manager.  We have resolved this and we are actively
   working to get back to a consistent release schedule.
 - A CloudStack Collaboration Conference was held in Montreal from June 1-3.
   The event went very well and the community was engaged and supportive.
   Videos from the event will be published soon so the broader community who
   where not able to attend are able to take advantage of the content.
 - A CloudStack Collaboration Conference is scheduled to be hosted in Brazil
   on Sept 29-30, we are not aware of any ASF conflicts at this time.
 - We are actively reviewing some community contributed artwork for "powered
   by apache cloudstack".  The current "powered by apache" trademark
   templates do not represent our brand very well, so we are reviewing some
   alternatives.  The artwork in question is currently available here:
   [http://poweredbycloudstack.bitcloud.cloud/](http://poweredbycloudstack.bitcloud.cloud/)
 - It still remains to be seen if the Accelerite purchase of CloudPlatform
   from Citrix will impact the ACS community in any way.  We are hopeful that
   the change will enable the CloudPlatform developers to more actively
   collaborate with the ACS project.  We will remain diligent to make sure
   there are no conflicts of interest for the ACS project.
 - The Schuberg Philis fork of Apache CloudStack does not seem to be
   negatively affecting the ACS project in a substantial way.  Their
   developers were very active in our community and the development process,
   so we definitely miss their direct contribution.  They have remained
   relatively active in the community and have been periodically backporting
   bug fixes for our project.
 - We continue to focus on improving the CI workflow and tools available for
   testing the ACS software.  This activity is expected to continue getting a
   lot of focus over the remainder of the year.
 - We are working to make the release cycle less dependant on a single person
   as release manager and are working to add more structure around the
   release process.
 - We are in the early stages of introducing an LTS release of the ACS
   software every 6 months to better address the enterprise use case for our
   software.
 - We are in the early stages of working out how to best publish a roadmap
   for the project and who is working on what.  The lack of a roadmap and
   inconsistency in our release schedule have been hightlighted as a
   potential barriers for adoption of our software, so we are actively
   working to address these areas.


## Health report:

 - Committee Health score: 10.00 (Super Healthy) from reporter.apache.org
 - The community, in general, seems to be in concensus on the different
   topics we need to be focusing on as a project.  Primarily testability and
   CI workflows, and consistency in our release schedule.  The move of our
   `apache/cloudstack` github repository to the `apachecloudstack` github org
   will help us better address these areas, so we are eager for that to take
   place.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:

The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

The last report was on March 16 2016.

## Issues:

The Apache Commons private mailing list [1] and development list [7] have been
notified that a number of Commons Math developers have forked the Commons
Math component as a new project called Hipparchus [2] instead of
continuing with establishing a new Apache Math TLP. Many members of the
Commons project feel that the Commons PMC should make the board aware
of this fact. The PMC does not request board action at this time but we
welcome board input.

## Activity:
 - The project is active with 10 releases this reporting period, one new
   component being readied for release through the incubator (Commons Crypto)
   and one component loosing developers (Commons Math.) and having been
   forked (See "Issues.")

## Health report:
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively
   maintained (10 releases). We've welcomed many new committers through a new
   components: Apache Commons Crypto. The dev list is active.  JIRA is
   active. Speed of responses to users is reasonable in most cases.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 35 PMC members.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

Report from the Apache Cordova committee [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description:

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We had three patch platform releases: iOS, Ubuntu and Windows.

Windows had one minor platform release, version 4.4.0, which included
significant improvements and features.

There were also 27 plugin releases, and minor cordova-cli releases (6.1.0 and
6.2.0), which includes an improvement that allows for plugin developers to
give a mapping of plugin releases to project requirements, greatly enhancing
plugin compatibility for platform and cli versions. We also released an
improved documentation search update on http://cordova.apache.org

## Health report:

For this period, we managed two overall plugins releases (same as last
quarter) when our goal was to have one plugins release per week, although we
had individual plugin releases as well. We had a slight decrease (27 vs 34)
of plugins that were released this quarter versus last quarter.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.6.0 was released on 4/3/16.

-Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 was released on 1/9/16.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY
The past three months saw the first of what we hope are many "Apache
FlexJS World Tour" events.  In early April we invited people to attend a one-
day orientation and hackathon on FlexJS, a version of Flex that is independent
from the Adobe Flash Platform.  Many folks attended on-line as well.  Some
potential committers are hopefully among them.   In addition, 2 PMC members
attended ApacheCon NA and reported larger than expected attendance.  Most
activity seems to be centered around FlexJS, with the main focus being on
Maven Integration, plus efforts to show that FlexJS is a more efficient way to
build applications with other JS frameworks and even for building Apache
Cordova apps.  New capabilities like XML support and source maps have also
been added.

COMMUNITY
-Olaf Krüger was added as a committer.
-No new PMC members this quarter.
-Last PMC addition was Josh Tynjala on Wed Sep 16 2015.  Committers not on the
PMC haven't been highly active, so we have not discussed promoting any of them
to the PMC at this time.

-Latest analytics include over 1000 hits per day on the website during the
work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 7000 installs of Apache Flex 4.15.0 since its release in
January.
-There were more than 200 installs of Apache FlexJS 0.6.0 since its release in
April.
-Over 71,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex is a
set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
contact them, they have not responded. We have asked Trademarks@ for advice on
next steps.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine.  Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.  Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache
projects in the broader ecosystem of technology around Apache Hadoop and
Apache Kafka.

ISSUES

 - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

 - Shane informed us that the "Apache Flink" trademark has been approved,
   but still needs to be officially issued.

 - Since the 1.0 release, the community growth seems to have accelerated.

 - As a response, the community decided to promote a "shepherd" concept
   within the community.  Every component (like API, distributed runtime,
   library, ...) has one or more shepherds, which are experts of that
   component, and act as people to contact for issues and questions that
   cannot be answered by the broad community.

   We decided to go with the name "shepherd", rather than "maintainer",
   because it is a non-authoritative role, but a guiding role.

   Shepherds are mostly committers, but also some non-committers volunteered.
   This looks like a nice way to identify prospects for future committers.

   The shepherds should also feel responsible for driving/moderating (not
   deciding) the resolution of community contributions.

   We are still in the phase of trying this out, hope to be able to report
   results in the next board report.

 - There will be a conference on Apache Flink and Stream Processing in
   September called "Flink Forward" (http://flink-forward.org/). The
   organizers are in touch with the PMC. The program committee will be five
   people from the Apache stream processing ecosystem.

 - Flink has been integrated with more Apache projects, like BigTop (done by
   the Flink and BigTop community) and Mahout (mostly done by the Mahout
   community).

 - Since the 1.0 release, the community brought measures in place to check
   binary backwards compatibility.

 - So far, the Flink community has accepted the majority of contributions,
   such as for connectors for integration with external systems.  We have,
   however, seen quite a few times the contributors were not interested in
   following up and maintaining the contribution, and a tough maintenance job
   was imposed on the community for barely used and unfamiliar code.

   As a results, there are discussions about encouraging contributors to
   create individual independent projects for such connectors, if there are
   no additional people in the community that would back the contribution.

COMMUNITY

There was no new PMC addition since the last report.

The latest PMC addition was July 2nd, 2015 (Maximilian Michels)
The latest committer addition was on March, 8th, 2016 (Greg Hogan)

Flink currently has 23 committers and 16 PMC members.

RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:

 - 1.0.1 was released on Tue Apr 05 2016
 - 1.0.2 was released on Fri Apr 22 2016
 - 1.0.3 was released on Wed May 11 2016

Development speed continues to be healthy.

 - 439 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 318 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Compared to previous quarters, dev mailing list activity is increasing
a bit, but user mailing list activity is increasing a lot.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Some development activity fixing a git problem, Gump seems to create
useful results for the few projects that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

We had some back and forth tweaking the git integration as we tried to
make Gump pick up changes to file attributes and realized some builds
had become stale. Other than that the projects that use Gump have
occasionally modified their respective configuration files.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
49 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months) (87 emails sent in the past
3 months, 94 in the previous cycle)

commits@gump.apache.org:
22 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months) (41 emails sent in the past
3 months, 25 in the previous cycle)

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for June 2016

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 56 podlings currently undergoing incubation.  We have one
podling planning to graduate this month and added two podlings to the
roster.  May was a generally quiet month, adding a single IPMC member,
and completing four releases.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Joe Witt

* New Podlings

 - Pony Mail
 - Fluo


* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Twill

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  May:

  - 2016-05-05 Apache Mynewt 0.8.0
  - 2016-05-24 Apache Tephra 0.8.0
  - 2016-05-24 Apache CommonsRDF 0.2.0
  - 2016-05-24 Apache Mnemonic 0.1.2

* Legal / Trademarks

  - A comment on a recent Podling Name Search indicated that there was a
    desire to have PNS's come later on during incubation.  Many IPMC members
    seem to believe that they should happen earlier.  An email requesting
    clarification has been sent.

* Infrastructure

  - Multiple former podlings are reporting delays in being converted to TLPs.

* Miscellaneous

  - The CMDA podling is now 2 months behind.  In response to the lack of
    activity, a mentor has begun retirement discussions with the podling.

Atlas

Apache Atlas is a scalable and extensible set of core foundational governance
services that enables enterprises to effectively and efficiently meet their
compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows integration with the complete
enterprise data ecosystem

Atlas has been incubating since 2015-05-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Podling name search is pending.
  2. Expand the community and add more committers.
  3. The upcoming release for Atlas (0.7-incubating) will be nearly 6 months
     since the last one. We would like to improve on this by making more
     frequent releases, and also encourage the community to discuss in
     release roadmaps etc.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No specific issues at this time to report.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. The user/dev community show increasing interests. In the last two
     months, the average number of messages has increased to more than 900
     messages per month, from an average of 400 per month in the last
     report.
  2. Around 7 contributors were added, number of contributors is at 49
     currently. Community is more widespread with more organizations
     participating in the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. We are working towards a 0.7-incubating release around the next month.
     This release will include several new features to make Atlas enterprise
     ready including: Authentication and authorization support, High
     availability, deeper integrations with other Hadoop components
     including Hive, HDFS, Falcon etc., Entity versioning, support for
     rolling upgrade, support for creating business taxonomies, enhanced
     user interface, better performance etc.
  2. There are more strategic contributions coming in to make the system
     agnostic to the underlying graph database version, and improve
     horizontal scalability.
  3. A total of 216 issues were reported between April 1st 2016 and May 30th
     2016. 84 have been resolved in the same time.

Date of last release:

  2015-12-31 - 0.6-incubating

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  1. Suma Shivaprasad was added as a PPMC member on 2016-05-03.
  2. Hemanth Yamijala was added as a committer on 2016-04-14 and PPMC member
     on 2016-04-29.

CommonsRDF

Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Find concrete target goals that could make the project viable as a
     Commons component.
  2. Work with key target communities (Apache Jena and Eclipse RDF4J) to
     ensure Commons RDF meets potential user requirements and expectations
     towards next versions of the Commons API.
  3. Re-engage and grow the Commons RDF community base.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  More key people (Andy Seaborne this time) has left the podling due
  lack of time. Mentor Rob Vesse has also resigned for the
  same reason.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community have been compacted with the lost of some key people. We still
  aim to attract a more broader RDF community, both in and out of ASF.

  Mailing list stats:

  dev@commonsrdf traffic
  Mar 2016: 45
  Apr 2016: 75
  May 2016: 18


  Jira stats for last 90 days:
  Created: 7
  Resolved: 6


How has the project developed since the last report?

  Project's development has resumed the work in the last weeks, being able
  to cast a 0.2.0-incubating release https://s.apache.org/rd0E

  Achieving such milestone has reactivated the discussion about the future
  of the project. All options have been put on the table, even retiring
  the podling; but currently the most likely option looks to be graduating
  as a Apache Commons component.

  Rather than the original plan of aiming for each RDF frameworks to adapt
  Commons RDF, the project is now experimenting with its own integration
  bindings in the style of Commons VFS. Discussions will continue in the
  next weeks.


Date of last release:

  2016-05-24 apache-commonsrdf-0.2.0-incubating

Fluo

Fluo is a distributed system for incrementally processing large data sets
stored in Accumulo.

Fluo has been incubating since 2016-05-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Attract new contributors.
  2. Establish an Apache website for Fluo that makes it easy for new users
     and contributors to get started.
  3. Do a release.  We should be able to start working on our first release
     as soon as we are fully established on Apache infrastructure

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No


How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community is the same as when it started incubation a few weeks ago.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is the first Fluo report.  We are trying to get established within
  Apache infrastructure.  Mailing lists are setup.  Need to import code.  We
  are working with INFRA to explore using Github for issue tracking.  See
  INFRA-11900.

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There was a discussion in the first quarter of the year to move the
  project to attic unless it is able to release in the next few months. No
  release happened since then.

  The project would like to have some kind of maintenance mode within
  Apache, where things like community growth and releases are not that
  important, as long there's a bit of support provided and "anyone" is still
  alive. The problem with attic is the read-only state of the repo, which
  makes it impossible to do anything (even if it's rare).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not grown and only a few mails on the dev list in the last two months.
  No support requests the last two months.

  Bill Rowe stepped in as a mentor.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The build process using autotools on Linux has been fixed and there was a
  discussion about supported build tools, because currently the project
  heavily relies on the unsupported cpptasks framework. While there was no
  actual result, the common focus was on dropping cpptasks and ANT for the
  build of the software and use autoconf and/or cmake instead.

  Additionally, one project member was willing to make himself more familiar
  with the release process, but there was no progress reported in the last
  month.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

Shepherd/Mentor notes:
  I have explained that there is no "maintenance mode" for a standalone project.
  However, if the project can demonstrate that it can produce a release and has
  enough people to maintain the project then it can rejoin the logging project
  where it can essentially exist in maintenance mode much like log4php is.

  The project moved to the incubator because there were people who said they
  wanted to get involved with the project and were willing to get involved.
  To date, one person has been actively involved but not enough to produce a
  release. One other person was involve in a discussion on the release process.


--------------------
Mnemonic

Mnemonic is a Java based non-volatile memory library for in-place structured
data processing and computing.

Mnemonic has been incubating since 2016-03-03.

On 05/24/2016, we released our first official build at
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/mnemonic/0.1.2-incubating/

Various metrics for May are as follows: (5/3-5/31/2016)

  +------------------------------------------+

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache releases: Community voted and released Mnemonic-0.1.2-incubating
  2. Expand and build strong community, keep active dev list discussions
  3. Develop new features: We are working in Native computing layer design

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Yanping and Gary presented Mnemonic project at ApacheCon Big Data
  Conference. Yanping presented at In-Memory Computing Summit. Both talks
  were well received. Several developers approached us to ask additional
  details on how Mnemonic worked for Spark. They are interested to see if we
  are able to successfully integrate Mnemonic into other projects.

  While we are focusing on develop new features, we will try to contact
  other projects' communities to explore integration opportunities. As the
  official release is done this month, for the next 3 months we expect
  integration activities will be increased.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have been focusing the first Apache release over the past weeks.

  We also explored ideas on design native computing layer which will further
  enhance durable Java object model on large non-volatile memory.

Date of last release:

  2016-05-24

OpenAz

OpenAz

OpenAz is a project to create tools and libraries to enable the
development of Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) Systems in a
variety of languages. In general the work is at least consistent with
or actually conforming to the OASIS XACML Standard.

OpenAZ has been incubating since 01-2015.


Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increasing community involvement: We are focusing on getting
     information published on the website to aid the acquisition and
     orientation of new contributors, as well increasing the number of
     committers, in order to reduce individual member workload, reduce
     reliance on any particular member, and to increase project velocity.
     David Ash was voted in as a committer last month.  There are several
     other committers that may be added in the near future.
  2. Merging the source code from AT&T, JP Morgan and Oracle and creating
     POMs. AT&T and JP Morgan source code has been merged and POMs created,
     it needs uploading into the Apache repository. AT&T and JP Morgan ICLAs
     were received, but Oracle is taking more time. The IP clearance is on
     it's way.
  3. Get our first release done.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None. The efforts to revive the project seem to be paying off and
  discussions are gaining traction.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Pam Dragosh, David Ash and Ajith Nair are the active committers at this
  point. The project intends to reboot the PPMC which may include removing
  some of the initial commiters who are no longer active. There are,
  however, several contributors who could be potentially added as committers
  in the future.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Ongoing collective effort to improve project documentation, marketing
     material for better visbility and adoption.
  2. A pending contribution towards PEP implementation is being reviewed and
     we plan to merge in these changes soon.
  3. We are looking into design feedback/comments from Nextlabs - a XACML
     service provider. We hope to incorporate many of these in the coming
     weeks.

Quarks

Apache Quarks is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime that can
be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling local,
real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming from
equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of all kinds
(for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in conjunction with
centralized analytic systems, Apache Quarks provides efficient and timely
analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.

Quarks has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around Quarks project
  2. Create the first Apache release of Quarks
  3. Complete the product name search and select a suitable name

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Due to trademark concerns with "Quarks", the Quarks PPMC voted to change
  the project's name. A renaming discussion and public vote was held on the
  dev mailing list. The voting results are being discussed privately by the
  PPMC.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have added two new committers and PPMC members, Kathy Saunders and
  Queenie Ma. Kathy has taken the lead on the name search process for
  Quarks, and her positive attitude and helpfulness are an incredible asset
  for the Quarks community. Queenie has contributed content to the website
  and is a frequent participant in community discussions. The Quarks
  community is still small, as Quarks has just recently incubated, therefore
  we aim to continue growing our list in the near future.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * According to JIRA, the project has added 27 new issues in May, and 22
    issues have been resolved.
  * On May 12, several Quarks contributors hosted an "Apache Quarks on
    Raspberry Pi" webcast where they showed how to use Quarks to work with
    real sensor data on a Raspberry Pi, and demonstrated a smart sprinkler
    application using Quarks.

Date of last release:

  Quarks is still new, so we haven't created an Apache release as of yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  In May, we added two new committers and PPMC members, Kathy Saunders and

Quickstep

Quickstep is a high-performance data processing platform that aims to fully
exploit the vast and increasing amount of parallelism that is packed in
individual nodes. The project’s initial target is interactive in-memory data
warehousing workloads, and early results indicate that Quickstep is over an
order-of-magnitude faster than existing platforms including Spark 2.0 and
PostgreSQL 9.6 Beta1.

Quickstep has been incubating since 2016-03-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Acquire early adopters
  2. Build a community.
  3. Create an ASF release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

    into more concrete outreach steps.

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    Really, at least goal #2 should be "make a first ASF release". Hopefully
    we can work with the community to get a sense how important it is in
    addition to growing a community (all 3 goals in this report).

    the last release and whether they think there will be a release
    soon.  I also expressed my concern on not having added any
    committers and asked if there were any contributors who looked
    like they might be a good candidate for committership.

--------------------
Singa

Singa is a distributed deep learning platform.

Singa has been incubating since 2015-03-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community. We anticipate stronger growth of the community when
     the upcoming, major release (v1.0) is available. SINGA v1.0 will have
     new programming abstractions and be able to run on heterogeneous
     hardware (e.g., using Cuda and OpenCL). It will also have improved
     usability in terms of installation and training new models, etc (see
     details below).
  2. Clean and improve existing documentations. We plan to replace the
     website template with a better one.
  3. Focus on Rafiki --- SINGA-based deep learning as a service.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The Github repository has scored 602 stars and 205 forks.

  There were 107, 73 and 37 emails from dev@ list in March 2016, April 2016
  and May 2016 respectively.

  There were 9, 35, and 30 commits in March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  In April 2016, we released our third version, i.e. v0.3.0, with the
  following major features:

  * Training on GPU cluster
  * Python wrapper improvements
  * New SGD updaters
  * Remove several dependencies for single node training.
  * Heterogeneous training with CPU and GPU.
  * Support cuDNNv4.

  In May, we started working on the first major release (v1.0) with the
  following notable features(http://singa.apache.org/develop/schedule.html):

  * Cross-platform
  * Support heterogeneous hardware: CUDA, OpenCL
  * Enhance programming abstraction, focusing on Tensor as core abstraction.
  * Python binding, cloud integration (Spark, Hadoop, etc.)
  * Runtime optimization.

  We are working on a system called Rafiki which uses SINGA to provide deep
  learning as a service and has the following features:

  * Sharing of pre-training models
  * Visualizing training progress
  * Configuring model via GUI (web browsers)

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Gates:
    I sent an email to the community sharing my concerns about the slow
    progress of adding new committers and asking if they had any contributors
    that looked like they might be ready for committership.

  Ted Dunning:
    The trend in dev mailing list traffic is worrisome as well. The opposite
    trend in JIRA volume is curious.

--------------------
Streams

Apache Streams (incubating) unifies a diverse world of digital profiles
and online activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes
these datasets accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and
platforms for streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Community growth and PMC maturity.
  2. Demonstrate a consistent release schedule.
  3. Participation of project community within related standards-bodies and
     Apache projects.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  # of contributors submitting and reviewing pull requests and participating
  in discussions is still too low.  Getting the attention of developers who
  work with social datasets and highlighting the ways that adopting and
  contributing to streams could provide value for their projects remains our
  biggest challenge and opportunity in community growth.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several recently in-active project contributors participated again this
  quarter.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  http://streams.incubator.apache.org has been completely overhauled, and
  following several talks given at ApacheCon NA 2016, a new blog post, and a
  renewed focus on marketing we’re beginning to see a payoff in the form of
  a consistent level of unique visitors, according to google analytics.

Taverna

Taverna is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute
data-driven workflows.

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Project maturity evaluation
  2. Releasing main code base (RC under vote)
  3. Engaging user/devops community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  ASF guidance on US export ECCN cryptography registration
  https://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html
  has not yet been updated for the 2010 rule changes, confusion
  around this classification caused Taverna delays.

  Lack of active mentors - would appreciate another volunteer.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Two new GSOC students now active.

  2-3 other new potential contributors discussing new work.

  A total of 4 ICLAs registered - however these folks need
  further encouragement and guidance to submit regular pull
  requests.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Preparations for release of the main workflow engine has had focus,
  including build stability across platforms,
  documentation update and US Export classifications of
  encryption items (which caused some delays).

  Taverna Engine/Command Line Release candidate now under vote.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig] June 2016

## Description:
   The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
   implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
   (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).
   The Jackrabbit Oak sub-project is an effort to implement a
   scalable and performant hierarchical content repository for use as
   the foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding
   content applications. In contrast to the initial implementation
   Oak does not implement all optional features from the JSRs and
   is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
   Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All
   maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are
   continuously seeing high activity. This quarter saw the third
   major release of Oak (1.4).

   Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of
   the work going into bug fixing and tooling.

   A XSS vulnerability was discoverd and fixed. See
   *  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-3950
   * https://mail-search.apache.org/pmc/private-arch/jackrabbit-private/
     201602.mbox/%3C56C8B688.3000703@apache.org%3E
   *

## Health report:
   The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic
   on all mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective
   component / sub-project.
   Commit activity is high as we just entered a new release cycle.
   The oak-dev list is seeing some interesting and controversial
   discussions.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Hendrik Saly]

## Project description

Apache Johnzon is an implementation of JSR-353 (JavaTM API for JSON
Processing) and a set of useful extension for this specification like an
Object mapper, some JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Issues

There is one outstanding infrastructure INFRA-11764 which covers the cleanup
and the transition from the incubator to a TPL:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-11758

No one cares about it so I would kindly ask the Board to take action here.
This ticket is also blocking us from the next release.

## Status

Currently in the process of performing the graduation out of the incubator.
There is ongoing work to make Johnzon JSR-367 (JSON-B) compliant. Its also
planned to implement JSR-374 (JSON-P 1.1), the successor of JSR-353.

## Releases

Johnzon graduated from the Apache Incubator on April 20, 2016. Last release
was on Feb. 17, 2016 (0.9.3-incubating). No new release since then. Next
planned release: 0.9.5 in June 2016.

## Committers and PMC membership

The last committer we signed up was Reinhard Sandtner on April 12, 2016. The
last PMC member was Hendrik Saly, voted in on April 9, 2015.

## Project activity

Since the last report (submitted last month) there was middle activity. We had
8 new Jira issues and fixed 5 of them. On the mailing list there are no
unanswered questions left. On the dev list we have 28 subscribers currently
and 10 msg sent per week last month in average. Since last report we saw
mailing list activity from two new people and also Jira issues from new
contributors.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description
Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.


## Activity
Labs activity is virtually nonexistent. Since being elected as PMC
chair I have had to handle more spam email to the lists than actual
correspondence of any kind. I'm not aware of any commits, there are no new
proposals, and I don't know how to find the mailing list subscriber stats, but
I would be surprised if it had changed.


## Issues
I have put some questions to the community about the future of the
project and had a handful of responses, it seems from that small sample that
there is some consensus around the idea that labs no longer fills a valuable
purpose at the ASF.

There are then options as to how we proceed, basically we can vote to shut
labs down, we can accept the status quo or we can attempt to pivot labs until
it becomes relevant.

During the next reporting period we will work on determining a way ahead, in
the meantime we would be grateful for any guidance the board may wish to
provide.

(N.B. I'm afriad I will be travelling at the time of this meeting and will be
unable to attend.)

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]
=== General ===
## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status

Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
The Olingo project released the latest 4.2.0 version in march as planned.
The next release is planned for the end of June.
There is also a vote open on a new patch release for the OData V2 code line.

The focus is still on OData V4. Most OData features have been implemented.
The remaining features are of a larger scope and thus take longer to implement.
This lead to fewer but bigger commits by the PMC members.
Overall we see fewer requests on the users mailing list. Interestingly we see
more JIRA tickets with patches from users. Mostly for the V2 code line.
So overall I would describe the health of the Olingo community as stable
compared to the last report.

The last report also mentioned a GitHub repository which was intended as a first
easy starting point for a JPA extensions. There have been no commits or any
further requests either on the user mailing list or the dev mailing list. I
would consider this a failed experiment. If a JPA extension for the V4 code line
is implemented it will most likely happen within the Apache repository. Although
some users have asked for such an extension in the past there haven´t been any
contributions which would speed up development.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

- Last release was 0.12 on Feb 19th 2016

We resolved 4 issues for this release.

The last few months have been quiet in development but there has been
movement to start merging some pretty large changes that were developed in
the last GSOC into our main development branch and release an OODT 1.0
release.

COMMUNITY

Latest committers and PMC members:

Radu Maonle (radumanole) on 28 Oct 2015 as committer and PMC member.

Mailing list activity has been pretty much static in terms of period on
period volume and Jira has been quiet.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

HEALTH REPORT

The project activity is pretty quiet, but there are still on going efforts in
place to help drive wider adoption. This includes a new website, greater
connectivity with other data platforms and adding some much desired features
to the core platform.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
"Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Activity is ok. We are atm mostly fixing and enhancing the
existing mainline.
A few OWB committers are actively contributing to the ALv2 licensed
CDI-2.0 specification.

## Health report:
The project is a container library which is stable and actively
used and maintained. Due to the fact that most users are using
OWB as part of another project (e.g. TomEE) we get much feedback
in ‚indirect‘ ways.
Note that the recent GoogVsOrcl case doesn’t affect OWB
as the CDI specification and TCK are both ALv2 licensed.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

There have been no new mod_perl 1.x releases since our last report.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

The most recent release on this branch was mod_perl 2.0.9 on June 18,
2015.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites that can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

Apache-Test 1.39 was last released on Apr 21, 2015

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production
userbase.

-- Users --

Support for users through the mailing list is ongoing.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

The PMC has currently 11 members

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description:
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.

Issues:
   I see the information about migration of Pivot-Extras, but haven't had
   time to pursue it since the last report.  Would appreciate a bit of
   help digging into the process.
   Otherwise, there are no board-level issues this time around.

Activity:
   Activity has been up a bit from last quarter with the new users still
   working and asking (a few) questions.  There has been some bug fix
   activity.  We should be able to do a new release (2.0.5) after one
   more bug is resolved (a Java 8 issue).

Health report:
   The new users we got recently and continued development by me has kept
   things going this quarter.  Long-term prospects are still uncertain
   as the market moves away from these kinds of platforms.  We still have
   three PMC members for votes.

PMC changes:
 - Currently 4 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016.

Committer base changes:
 - Currently 5 active (that is, not emeritus) committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago.

Releases:
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014

Mailing list activity:
   A couple more users started asking development questions, which is
   good.  But it was a slow quarter as far as actual development goes.
   The new users contributed some good questions, which were all
   resolved (I think).  Not quite as slow as some quarters go, so
   actually not bad.

 - dev@pivot.apache.org:
    - 63 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months):
    - 33 emails sent to list (55 in previous quarter)

 - user@pivot.apache.org:

 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months.
 - Activity has picked up just this last week (that is, after the
   reporting period).

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Jeff Trawick]

## Short version of report:

  No releases, no committee/committer changes, modest other activity
  (Same summary as for the March 2016 report)

## Description:

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 - APR provided an interim report in May 2016 to address a security
   response issue.

## Activity:
 - Commit activity has been low.
 - Mailing list activity has been very low.
 - Five unique, non-SPAM bugs were opened during the reporting period, and
   four had followup (closure or discussion).

## Health report:
 - This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
   driven by the needs of the same small number of applications that have
   used it for many years.  The project members are more than able to
   meet the requirements that arise from that use.
 - The needs of the small number of other users are not met very well;
   bug reports languish and mailing list posters may not receive timely
   responses.  The amount of help provided is probably not sufficient
   to serve as encouragement to potential new users of APR.

## PMC/Committer changes:

 - Currently 66 committers and 39 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Yann Ylavic on Wed May 13 2015
 - One committer added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Brian Havard on Wed May 04 2016

## Releases:

 - No releases in this quarter
 - APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
 - APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
 - APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007

    - 360 subscribers
    - 30 emails sent to list (86 in previous quarter)

 - commits@apr.apache.org:

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the las period we have provided the users with new maintenance releases
(5.5.4, 6.0.3) and new updates 5.6.1 and 6.1.1 from the development branches.
We have also released new OSGi bundle sets and ServiceMix Specs.

We can observe decreasing activity on dependency version used by the 5.5.x and
5.6.x versions, so we expect decreasing activity on ServiceMix 5 next months and
transiting it in 'end of life' state soon.

We plan to focus on ServiceMix 6 and ServiceMix 7 instead, to provide users with
latest and greatest technology and upgrades of Apache Karaf, ActiveMQ, Camel and
CXF versions. We plan to release new versions of ServiceMix 6 next weeks.

We are working on the new ServiceMix 7.0.0.M2 which should be released next days.
During the next period we plan to release the final version of ServiceMix 7 and
return to the work on migration of the documentation.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

The project is mature in that it has not seen rapid development of its
software component. SpamAssassin is widely used, and users do make use of the
regular updates of the rules.  There has not been much new development of the
code. Bug reports are being looked at and handled. There is active discussion
on the user list. Rule updates happen regularly.

Issues:

The project chair became unexpectedly unavailable last March. The PMC did not
determine the full circumstances until recently. The PMC has voted to nominate
Sidney Markowitz as the new chair. One issue with the sudden transition is
that the chair had set up the infrastructure for our “mass-check” that accepts
submissions of spam and non-spam email and drives our automated rule update
system. We are still trying to determine if anyone else knows the details or
at least has access to the infrastructure. The mass-check system itself has
been running smoothly, but lack of access for moving, changing, or fixing it
is a major concern.

Infra:

The last report that was submitted stated that Zones2 deprecation was stalled
due to disk space requirements. Now the status is that it is stalled until the
new chair can find out what that means and finish the task.

Releases:

The last release was version 3.4.1 on April 30, 2015. Last November the
project agreed that there are sufficient bug fixes in the 3.4 branch and it is
sufficiently stable to justify releasing 3.4.2 “soon”. There has been
development in the main (4.0) branch, but no discussion of a release schedule
for it. We need to close some remaining issues for 3.4.2 and sweep through
issues in the 4.0 branch to check for any fixed ones that should be ported or
open ones that really ought to be fixed in 3.4.2, then get the 3.4.2 release
out the door.

Committer/PMC changes:

The last new committer was added over two years ago. The last new member of
the PMC was three and a half years ago. The new chair has stated concern over
the stagnation that implies and will see if there is anything we can do about
it.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- The community is in the QA phase for Spark 2.0, our second major
  version since joining Apache. There are a large number of additions in
  2.0, including a higher-level streaming API, improved runtime code
  generation for SQL, and improved export for machine learning models.
  We are also using this release to clean up some experimental APIs,
  remove some dependencies, add support for Scala 2.12. The full list
  of changes is available at http://s.apache.org/spark-2.0-features.
  We also released a 2.0.0-preview package to let users broadly
  participate in testing the new APIs.

- We released Spark 1.6.1 in March, with bug fixes for the 1.6 branch.

- For Apache Spark 2.0, the community decided to move some of the
  less used data source connectors for Spark Streaming to a separate
  project, Apache Bahir (http://bahir.apache.org). We proposed a new
  project in order to maintain ASF governance of these components.

- The project removed the role of "maintainers" for reviewing changes to
  specific components (originally added 1.5 years ago) in response to
  concerns from some ASF members that it makes the project appear less
  welcoming, as well as the conclusion that it did not have a noticeable
  impact in practice (https://s.apache.org/DUTB, https://s.apache.org/AgCt).

Trademarks:

In the past few weeks, there have been several discussions asking for more
attention to trademark use from the PMC. Some of the main issues were:
- A vendor offering a "technical preview" package of Apache Spark 2.0
  before there was any official PMC release.
- A vendor claiming to offer "early access" to the project's roadmap.
- Various corporate and open source products whose name includes "Spark".
- Corporate pages were the most prominent mention says "Spark"
  instead of "Apache Spark".

The PMC is addressing these issues in several ways:

- Reaching out to the organizations involved.

- To make the project's association with the ASF clearer in news articles
  and corporate materials, we are working to update the logo to include
  "Apache": https://s.apache.org/Jf7J. We also added a FAQ entry about
  using the logo that links to the ASF trademarks page.

- Continuing to review news articles, product announcements, etc.

- Starting with this board report, we will have a section on
  trademarks in our reports to track brand activity.

- Question for the board: Would it be helpful to put a summary of the
  trademark policy on spark.apache.org? It would be nice to have this
  more visible (e.g. in the site's navigation menu), but either way is
  fine. We can draft a version and sent it to trademarks@.

Events:

- The Spark Summit community conference in San Francisco ran June 6-8.
  There were close to 100 talks from at least 50 organizations.

Latest releases:

- May 26, 2016: Spark 2.0.0-preview
- Mar 9, 2016: Spark 1.6.1
- Jan 4, 2016: Spark 1.6.0
- Nov 09, 2015: Spark 1.5.2
- Oct 02, 2015: Spark 1.5.1

Committers and PMC:

- The last committer was added on May 23, 2016 (Yanbo Liang).

- The last PMC members were added Feb 15, 2016

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project is doing fine on a low level. The major blocker is still the
stocked release process. People do not find the time to cut new releases
or to hand over the process to other PMC members.

The project is focused on easing the use of Stanbol and use resources like
Docker images. The project also received contributions in terms of improved
documentation which will be included in the near futur. In combination with
an improved release process Stanbol should become more easy to use to end
users.

The project voted for two new PMC members. The board has been notified but
we need to wait for the 72 hours period to end until we invite them
officially.

The vote for new PMC members is a first step to hand over the planned
improvements and the release process to a new generation of people.

Subscribers on the dev list: 231

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The community released verion 1.0, which was a major milestone.
 - Since the 1.0 release, we have accellerated our release rate in order to
   address bugs/issues in a timely manner.
 - Preparations for 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 releases are underway, with a release
   expected soon.
 - We had one trademark issue raised. It was addressed quickly and easily.
 - The PMC has been reminded of the importance of policing our trademark.

## Health report:

 - There has been a slight decrease in committer activity. This can likely
   be attributed to a "sigh of relief" after the 1.0 release, as well as a
   shift in priorities among some committers' day jobs.
 - We continue to regularly add new committers/PMC members at a rate of 2-3
   per quarter.


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 30 PMC members.
 - New PMC members:
    - Abhishek Agarwal was added to the PMC on Thu Jun 02 2016
    - John Fang was added to the PMC on Thu May 12 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 31 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - Abhishek Agarwal was added as a committer on Fri Jun 03 2016
    - John Fang was added as a committer on Tue May 10 2016

## Releases:

 - 0.10.1 was released on Wed May 04 2016
 - 1.0.0 was released on Sun Apr 10 2016
 - 1.0.1 was released on Wed May 04 2016

## Mailing list activity:

 - There has been a slight decrease in dev@ list activity as mentioned in
   the health report.
 - Activity on the user@ list has increased over the last quarter, most
   likely in response to the 1.0 release.

 - dev@storm.apache.org:
    - 530 subscribers (up 17 in the last 3 months):
    - 6503 emails sent to list (8827 in previous quarter)

 - user@storm.apache.org:
    - 1413 subscribers (up 47 in the last 3 months):
    - 1102 emails sent to list (645 in previous quarter)

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

The last committer and PMC member was added in May 2016:
  Ravi Undupitiya (ravi)

Last month Brett Porter informed our community about the process
for moving the project into the attic. Interestingly, this email
has had a significant rejuvenating effect on the project. Since
the email went out at least 4 volunteers have come forward who
have expressed strong interest in contributing to the project and
keeping it alive. One of them also volunteered to drive the next
Synapse release as the release manager. We have voted him in as
a committer and a PMC member, and he is currently working on fixing
open issues to get the release out.

Other volunteers have also been highly active in the project
over the past few weeks. As a result we have had more development
activity in Synapse over the last 3 weeks, than we have
had in 3 years. Given the current level of participation, our
chances of getting a release out soon is very good at the moment.
We intend to vote in rest of these new volunteers as committers
in the near future.

Releases
========

There have been no new releases since the last report.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on
January, 2012. Work is successfully underway for a 3.0 release.

Board Issues
============

In light of the new contributors who have come forward to resurrect
the project, we will not be pursing a move to attic at this point
in time. I (hiranya) will continue to serve and oversee
the project as the PMC chair until a replacement is found.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify
the development of user interfaces.

## Activity:
 Apache Tiles remains an stable but low traffic project. There remains two
responsible and responsive PMC ready to help users and discuss development
ideas. Other PMC come out to help when needed.

 Currently no members are active in development, and no contributions have
come in. The majority of activity happens on non-apache sites like the
StackExchange forums. StackExchange sees a few questions and answers each
day or two.

 This quarter saw input from an emeritus member Antonio, who had contributed
much of the rewrite to Apache Tiles-3. While Antonio looks not to actively
contribute again, but is using Tiles-3 again and will offer related
contributions and ideas when appropriate.

## Health report:
 Apache Tiles is a stable project seeing little new momentum. There are
currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with votes when needed.

 An initial effort was made to subscribe the StackExchange traffic into the
users mailing list, without luck. Since this is the best representation of
active traffic that we have this effort should be retried. Current members
need to be reaching out to other forums to show that the Apache community
is still there for them. Everyone is aware of the how little momentum the
project has, but it does not feel abandoned by members, nor not in use by
the public.

 The pending patch release really should be made the next quarter so to
verify the presence of 3+ PMC, as described above.

## Issues
 The board requested last report that less emphasis on the output of the
health reporter be used, and a more direct statement used to describe the low
health status that the project holds. Hopefully this has been addressed this
report.

## Releases:
 No releases were made this quarter. There is still a patch release pending,
no action has been taken so far.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
 Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
 (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

 This is TinkerPop's first month outside of incubation. We are still
 awaiting resource transfer changes related to graduation to take place as
 there are issues preventing the infrastructure team from completing that
 process.

 Project development has been building up to two new releases
 which are expected to be released in July. A key area of focus in this
 last month has been related to opening TinkerPop to non-JVM programming
 languages through the concept of Gremlin Language Variants[1]. In taking
 this direction, TinkerPop becomes more accessible to non-JVM developer
 communities.

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
 - 3.1.2 (April 8, 2016)
 - 3.2.0 (April 8, 2016)

## PMC/Committer:

 - Last PMC addition was Dylan Millikin - May 2016
 - Last committer addition was Michael Pollmeier - April 2016

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

Apache Tomcat is a Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java WebSocket, Java
Unified Expression language and Java Authentication Service Provider
Interface for Containers specifications implementation.

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Activity:
- Continued healthy activity across multiple components and responsiveness
  on both dev and user lists.
- Three presentations on Tomcat were given at ApacheCon NA and a meetup one
  evening was held with about ten participants.
- A spate of Bugzilla spam was succcessfully blocked by the infra team.
- Currently five branches are actively maintained. This will be reduced to
  three sometime later this year as 8.0.x reaches EOL (replaced by 8.5.x)
  and 6.0.x will be reach EOL at the end of this year.
- A roughly monthly release cycle is held up for 9.0.x, 8.5.x, 8.0.x and
  7.0.x and a roughly six monthly release cycle for 6.0.x.
- Open bugs (excluding enhancement requests and those where furthe
  information is required from the OP) are fixed before each release.
- There are three components where there is less activity.
  taglibs is dormant and it needs to be discussed whether it should be
  placed into Tomcat's attic.
  The Tomcat Maven Plugin needs committers. Currently it is only compatible
  with 7.0.x and lower, only.
  The connectors component is fairly mature will still sees bugs reports and
  needs committers in order to address them.
- Discussion about inviting a new committer has started with no conclusion
  yet.

Tomcat 9 has a dependency on the Servlet 4 specification which is part
of Java EE 8. There has been much public discussion about the (lack of)
progress [1] of Java EE 8. We do not intend to let this slow down Tomcat
development. We continue to review the situation and take action as
necessary. For example, Tomcat 8.5.x was introduced to make HTTP/2 (and
other new features) available in a production quality release so users
weren't waiting for Tomcat 9.

PMC changes:
 - Currently 24 PMC members.
 - Last PMC addition was Felix Schumacher on Mon Oct 26 2015

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description:
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The community had a fairly lengthy and productive discussion regarding the

   these ideas. We will try to work on this over the upcoming months.
 - Work is underway to clear out the few remaining open Jira issues for the
   next release, VCL 2.5. This is mostly janitorial work. No significant code
   needs to be worked on. We hope to begin the release process this month.

## Health report:
 - Mailing list traffic is up a bit since the last report. I expect dev
   traffic to increase as we release a new version and user traffic to
   increase afterwards.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Web Services Report for June 2016

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:

  WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
  mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
  However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixes,
  and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the
  project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based
  Web Services is no longer considered state of the art, we don’t expect a
  major uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented server-side web
application framework.

## Noteworthy items:

- Currently 30/29 Committers/PMC members.
- Last committer/PMC addition was François Meillet on Mon Jun 29 2015
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
- Mailinglist traffic is stable without significant changes
- An academic paper about architectural debt reviewed 7 Apache projects,
including Wicket.
- Work on Wicket 8 is in progress, a milestone release is imminent

## Releases this quarter

We have issued the following releases: 7.3.0 and 6.23.0.

## Academic paper about architectural debt

This article [1] references an academic paper about architectural debt that
has researched 7 large-scale open source projects from Apache: Camel,
Cassandra, CXF, Hadoop, HBase, PDFBox, and Wicket.

Though we don't have access to the ACM's library, the linked summary provides
some nice points about technical/architectural debt.

## State of the project

The outlook for the project's long term future hasn't changed since the
previous report. That said, there's interest in writing a new Wicket book.
Several PMC members have been queried by publishers and authors about this
effort. If such a book could appear is still not clear.

Development for Wicket 8 is slow, albeit ongoing. A first milestone release is
imminent, will be available for consumption later this month.

Releases have not followed a fixed schedule lately, but we intend to start on
a monthly or bi-monthly release schedule for the supported branches.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a mature project with small community which is
currently not very active. Although I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users, the overall PMC has been alive but not active. The
user community continue to help each other in couple of questions we have
received and they also contributing patches which is currently under review.

Last svn activity (March 2016) was a security fix provided by a user.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

A couple minor updates were recently committed, otherwise it's been
quiet on the development front over the last four months. There was
another user query on the mailing list about having a new release.
We still need volunteers to help drive one.

Mailing list traffic continues to be very low; only 20+ posts on
the j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of March 2016.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C has had a fair bit of activity as of late. Several JIRA
issues that were opened by the community have been investigated
and resolved since the beginning of June.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 65+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of March 2016.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-C 3.1.3 (February 17th, 2016).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C)
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

One new PMC member (Scott Cantor) was added to the PMC this month
(June 2016). The previous two additions to the PMC were in
May 2010.

Three committers have committed changes to SVN since March.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Since our last report the community has worked on adding some new features for
our existing downstream users, including a new tool for measuring code base
health according to the rules defined in the precommit patch test tool. We've
also been discussing easing getting started with the project through a
combination of additional documentation and making use of the new Apache Help
Wanted tool from comdev.

As planned, our Allen Wittenauer presented the project at ApacheCon BigData
and ApacheCon Core. Additionally he also gave a precommit patch test tool
specific overview to the Apache HBase community at a meetup in San Francisco.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

Description:

  Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
  Programming for domain-centric application development.

Activity:

  The activity during this last quarter has been (as usual) slow, but slightly
  higher than previous quarter. We have seen a handful of responses coming in
  via help.apache.org, but not managed to convert any into contributions, and
  we think that is the nature of that page (easy to click, even if no
  commitment is intended).

Issues:

  There are no issues that requires the Board's attention.

Health report:

  Attracting new blood is constantly on our mind, but we have no good answers.
  One new user surfaced and have been helped to get going. We hope to convert
  that to some more activity.
