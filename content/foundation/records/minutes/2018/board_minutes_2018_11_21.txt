 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       We continued to make slow but steady progress last month on strategic
       topics.  Research into endowment options is nearing completion with an
       initial  recommendation to be posted for discussion on the finance
       list.  I incorporated feedback from the kickoff meeting on the 5-year
       plan into a revised set of objectives and set up the wiki site [1].
       Some good discussions around ASF vision, assuring that contributors
       understand their obligations under the ICLA and the status of binary
       releases began this month.  I am happy to report that the tone of
       these discussions has been positive.  Thanks in advance to all who
       participate to keep it that way as we work through these and other
       important issues in the coming months.

       Three reports were complemented for their thoughtfulness and / or
       comprehension this month:  Flume, Ant and Incubator.  In a few cases,
       issues like those handled thoughtfully in those reports were observed
       by Directors reviewing list activity in other projects and they were
       encouraged to cover them in their reports.  Constructive feedback
       related to ensuring oversight, moving toward release and keeping
       discussion public whenever possible.

    B. President [Sam]

       Financially, we continue to significantly exceed income (by more
       than we did last year), and significantly under-run expense (by less
       than we did last year).  I neglected to kick off a bottoms up effort
       to collect input for a five year plan, which I will do by the end
       of the week.

       Other areas:

       Brand Management has a private matter seeking feedback from the board.

       Fundraising is operating smoothly and is exceeding targets.

       Low to average month in terms of activity for Marketing and Publicity,
       which generally is a good thing :-).

       Infrastructure is operating as expected, one notable item: the team
       will be moving from HipChat to Slack.

       Conferences has chosen a date for ApacheCon NA in Las Vegas, September
       9th through 12th, 2019.  DC road show has been postponed.  Other
       events are still in the planning stages.

       No Travel Assistance activity this month as we are between conferences.

       Finance continues to work on an Endowment proposal.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on Oct 31st, 2018 was $2,169.5K, which is up  $73.2K
       from last month's ending balance (Sep 18) of $2,096.3K. Total Cash as
       of Oct 31st, 2018 is $3,563.4K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $1,690.5K on Oct 31st 2017. The Oct 2018
       ending Operating cash balance of $2,169.5K represents an Operating
       cash reserve of 13.8 months based on the FY19 conservative Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $157.1K/month.  The ASF actual
       Operating reserve of 13.8 months at the end of Oct 2018 is ahead of
       the budgeted 11.1 month reserve for YTD through Oct 2018. The ASF
       Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of
       the ASF's size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income was ahead of FY 18 at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $151.9K.  As compared to the FY 19
       Budgeted Income, YTD we are ahead by $241.4K as compared to being
       ahead of budget at the end of Sept 2018 by $34.3K, a significant
       increase.

       YTD expenses through Oct 31st, 2018 are under budget by $228.7K, as
       compared to being under budget in expense by $329.1K at the end of Sep
       2018.  All depts. are under budget at the end of Oct 2018.  The timing
       variance has narrowed a bit as can be seen by the reduction in
       the amount under budget from Sept 2018 to Oct 2018.   There are
       still a couple worth mentioning, one being Infra, as noted in
       the Board summary is $112.1K under budget due to Timing of
       hiring of staff and timing of Lease web invoices.  The other
       being TAC at $45K under budget YTD for FY19.  We have moved
       most of the dept underspending forward in the Cash forecast and
       will be reviewing the underspending with the departments as we
       move forward in FY19 Q3.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $99.5K NI vs a budgeted negative <$370.6K> NI or $470.1K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This was
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments offset by more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in all depts
       YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are doing very
       well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking
       timing variances into account.  We will continue to monitor this as
       we move further into FY19.  With regard to FY18, we are outpacing
       revenue but are also out pacing expenses, and therefore training in
       NI year over year, but again significantly ahead of FY19 budget in
       all categories.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of Secretary is operating well with plenty of support from
       whimsy and the Assistant Secretary.

       In October, 62 ICLAs, two CCLAs, and four grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       =============

       Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
       bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

       Possible financial impact from level of Slack usage. Team are
       monitoring.

       Reviewing resumes to fill two open headcount.

       Cloud credits from one provide have been renewed, with a commitment to
       three years. This allows for an expansion of GitBox. It's good to see
       cloud providers willing to provide stability to the foundation through
       three year commitments.

       There was a security issue with our Sonarcube analysis server, this
       has been resolved without any known impact.

       =======================

       Marketing and Publicity is operating as expected, and has no current
       issues to bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

       DC road show has been postponed, due to difficulties with sponsors,
       and \the venue.

       Chicago Road Show, 2019 proposal submitted by, and championed by,
       Trevor Grant.

       Discussion around ApacheCon EU 2019 has stalled. Assistance is both

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board. This report
covers two months, as we missed our report in October.

The Infrastructure Team has "taken over" management of the-asf.slack.com, 
and will be using that for our needs going forward (as Atlassian's
HipChat has been end-of-life'd). As a side-effect, we will officially
support this Slack workspace for existing channels/projects, and for
those who may join going forward. We signed up for Slack's NGO
benefits for the workspace, though it is possible that heavy usage may
move us into a range where we will be billed for some usage. We will
continue to monitor the usage, billing, and determine if any
strategies are needed to keep the Foundation's chat expenditure down.

Finances
========
We are operating within/ahead of budget. We are actively processing
submitted candidate resumes to fill two open headcount, which our
budget will cover once we fill the positions.

Our renewed sponsorship of cloud credits has arrived, with the
requested three year duration and a generous credit. We will be using
these credits to expand our GitBox service to all of our projects.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete our hiring process.
- Finish deprecation/replacement of the Zmanda backup service with
  rsync-based backup. (this will save on licensing costs)

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Turn off all of our old hardware. Some projects are still on this
  hardware, along with some core Infrastructure services. This creates
  both stability and security issues for us.

General Activity
================
- ACNA in Montreal was a success for the team. We spent a lot more
  time together this year, than our time in Miami (May 2017). We
  accomplished a long list of tasks that took advantage of the higher
  bandwidth of face-to-face communications.
- Continued work on GitBox, in preparation for moving all projects
  over from git-wip.
- Work on replacing our email infrastructure (from an old FreeBSD
  system creaking along, to an Ubuntu-based server) continues. The old
  server lives under a decade of patches and custom work, so our
  largest hurdle is archeology. The new server is reaching a state for
  testing, and then slow migration in a month or three.
- Various work on making our monitoring, logging, and alerting
  processes more regular across our multitude of VMs.
- A number of our donated Jenkins nodes had small drives, which had
  been causing problems. The sponsor has upgraded those VMs to larger
  drives, and we've re-imaged and re-integrated them into Jenkins.
- We had a security issue with our Sonarcube analysis server that has
  been resolved, along with assisting some projects to use the new setup.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We have signed a contract to produce ApacheCon North America 2019 at
the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas, September 9th through 12th, 2019.
We have also entered an agreement with Virtual for the production of
that event.

You will see announcements over the coming days, to every mailing list
you're on, about this event, and we ask that you help amplify that
message.

The DC road show has been postponed, due to a variety of difficulties
with sponsors, and with the venue. We hope to have an updated date for
that event within the next few weeks.

Discussion continues around the Chicago Road Show, 2019, with a
proposal for the event being submitted by, and championed by, Trevor
Grant.

Discussion around ApacheCon EU 2019 has stalled, and we need to get
that going again. Two people have stepped up to assist with that
effort so that I, Rich, don't have to carry that event myself, and
this is hugely appreciated.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

VP of Finance 2018 Report,

The major activity that occurred this month was my meeting with a
partner from one of the largest CPA firms in Massachusetts mainly to
discuss his experience with his clients Endowments and some other
topics.  A note will be coming out on the Finance@ list, in the near
future.

I was also able to attend the monthly Fundraising call in October and
have been working on assisting and adding Guidance where I can.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

I would like to request board's attention on the CCLA discussion that's been
simmering for a month or so now. There are no other issues that require board
attention at the moment.

Legal Affairs committee for the past month has been mostly business as usual
with an average number of LEGAL jiras coming in and requiring our attention.
Once again, Assistant V.P., Legal Affairs has been doing excellent job at
triaging legal JIRAs and making sure we make progress on addressing our
backlog. We are currently at 22 open JIRAs with the oldest dating back to Jan
2017.

Mark Radcliffe arranged for a meeting with the Intellectual Property Counsel of
a major US corporation that was focused on educating them on the evolution
of Apache License and general ASF's policies around patent trolling.

I've been approached by members of the Silicon Valley VC community involved in
Common Clause discussions seeking to build more of a relationship with ASF.
The initial conversation went well and I expect them to follow up on a
legal-discuss mailing list.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Chris Mattmann]

The RFC period is underway for our draft privacy policy. Several members and
VP infrastructure have weighed in. I will continue to collect feedback through
the CY, and publish the draft in Jan 2019 with whatever feedback and comments
received by then. Keep them coming.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

Note that this report will be limited as it only covers one month. This
is primarily being used as an opportunity to respond to the query raised
following the report submitted in October. See below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

Since the last report, the sprint mentioned in the report from October has
happened. As a first sprint the main thrust of this was to iron out some
details and agree on some limited goals to progress work on the bloodhound
core experiment. The chair is expected to arrange further sprints to help
define a definite period over which they can look to try to work on the
project with some immediate advice being available from others.

Further discussion on this may be expected in the December report.

Responses to Board Queries
==========================

> idf: Can you please check/ confirm that there are at least three PMC
>        members providing oversight?

We can confirm that this is the case at the moment. We are cutting it fine
at three PMC members who are active enough to qualify for the moment. These
are John Chambers, Gary Martin and Dammina Sahabandu. There have been the
occasional interjections from others but we stop short of suggesting any
more than three are active for the moment.

We are obviously concerned with this but consider the best way to deal with
this is to make progress, look more appealing (by the move to frameworks
that are either already more familiar or would benefit new committers to
learn and apply beyond this project) and generally easier to contribute
(looking at the use of git as a more familiar tool and looking at how other
Apache projects make use of pull requests.)

Attachment D: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage
service optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as
a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services
in companies like Twitter, Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log
segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for
Apache BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper
primitives. It is a subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - 4.8.0 was released on Wed Sep 26 2018
 - 4.8.1 is going to be released
 - The growth of Apache Pulsar community also help grow the adoption
of BookKeeper.
   This helps building the ecosystem around BookKeeper.
## Health report:

 - Development continues at a steady pace. We are merging multiple PRs per
week on average.
 - Mailing list and slack discussions are brisk, in particularly around the
active projects.
 - The community holds a bi-weekly meeting on Hangout.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Geoff Macartney]

## Description:
 - Apache Brooklyn is a software framework for modelling, monitoring and
   managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Development continues with a regular turnover of pull requests submitted
   and merged. We are pleased that the new UI has drawn some initial commits
   from new contributors.
 - Rather than making a 1.0.0 release of Brooklyn in the summer, we decided we
   would benefit from an interim release first, given that the new UI is so
   recent. Accordingly we have released Apache Brooklyn 1.0.0-M1 as a first
   milestone on our way to an official 1.0.0 release.


## Health report:
 - The project continues with a regular turnover of pull requests and commits,
   especially around the new UI that was contributed in May.
 - We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
   members with the aim of regularly adding individuals (see "PMC Changes").

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 16 PMC members.
 - Duncan Grant was added to the PMC on Thu Aug 30 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Duncan Grant at Wed Jun 13 2018

## Releases:

 - 1.0.0-M1 was released on Mon Sep 17 2018

## JIRA activity:

 - 9 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 The project is moving at a slow pace with a few commits in the last months.
Recently there was more activity directly on the github repository with 
multiple contributions from one person.
We have contacted that person and just confirmed that they'd be willing 
to engage in becoming a committer.

## Health report: 
The project has been stable for a long while and the space of build 
tools for Java projects has been overall stagnant for a number of years.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 9 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Tammo van Lessen at Fri Aug 08 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.5.6 on May 12th 2018

## Mailing list activity: 
 - users@buildr.apache.org:  
    - 125 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 4 emails sent to list (4 in previous quarter)

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Several months ago, DataStax had made a change around an assignment of IP
clause in the ICLA for their Java Driver (which serves as a reference
implementation for the native protocol) that had prevented some users from
contributing. We were able to work with them to get that change rolled back.
This was a pretty serious issue given that some features in-tree rely on the
driver as a dependency. We have asked to have the driver donated to the
project and they have declined.

We have recently voted to begin the process of importing the GoCQL driver, but
that project's policy of making every contributor an author may make this
impossible given we would have to get signoff from each person:
https://github.com/gocql/gocql/blob/master/AUTHORS

This quarter, we started a series of blog posts and have had a steady stream
of community contributions for content: http://cassandra.apache.org/blog/

The blog has been well received and is serving as a method for distributing
information about the changes we have been making for 4.0.
## Health report:
Project activity is up substantially in the context of development
discussions. We have moved into a freeze in anticipation of testing 4.0 and
have worked with the community to put together a testing plan for which many
members of the community have already signed up:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/4.0+Quality%3A+Components+and+Test+Plans

In parallel we have begun performance testing 4.0 and have already seen order
of magnitude improvements of cluster startup times, streaming data to new
nodes and internode messaging. This has been the direct result of a re-write
of the internode communication layer to rely on NIO via the Netty API. These
improvements have been tracked on the following parent issue:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14746

## PMC changes:
We have added four new PMC members during this period. There are currently 31
PMC members.
 - New PMC members:
    - Ariel Weisberg was added to the PMC on Tue Sep 25 2018
    - Benedict Elliott Smith was added to the PMC on Tue Sep 25 2018
    - Benjamin Lerer was added to the PMC on Wed Aug 15 2018
    - Stefania Alborghetti was added to the PMC on Thu Sep 27 2018

## Committer base changes:
There are currently 50 committers. No new committers added in the last 3
months.

## Releases:
The last release was 2.2.13 on Wed Aug 01 2018.

## Mailing list activity:
We have had a substantial uptick in traffic on the development mailing list as
a result of robust discussions around a feature freeze for 4.0, calls for
participation for testing 4.0, and inclusion of a side-car management process
for repair.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION 
Apache Clerezza models the RDF abstract syntax in Java and provides supports
for serializing, parsing, and managing triple collections, as well as a tool
to generate the source code of a Java class with constants for an ontology
described in RDF. Apache Clerezza components are OSGi-based and have the
purpose to ease building of Semantic Web applications and services.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD 

Question of the board to the previous report:
  rb: 5 years is a really long time with no change to your committer
      list. Are there any community members who you are actively
      mentoring towards committership?
Answer: No, there are not any.

Hasan sent a request to the dev list to vote whether to move Apache 
Clerezza to the Attic. Votes are expected within this week. 

RELEASE 
Latest release was partial-release-201604 created on May 13, 2016.

ACTIVITY
Refactoring of the 'reunited' branch of Apache Clerezza is still ongoing.

COMMUNITY 
Latest change was addition of a new committer and PMC member on 16.08.2013.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Latest update of the Apache Clerezza Website was in February 2018.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
 - The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
   involved with Apache Projects

## Issues:
 - No issues require board attention at the moment

## Activity:

Apache Project Logos: A key activity this quarter was the co-ordination and
set up a central logo page and repository [1] for high resolution logos for
all ASF projects. Feedback and participation from projects was extremely
positive and we have up to date versions of all ASF project logos available in
several formats.

New PMC Members and Committer: Two new PMC members have been added, Trevor
Grant and Ruth Suehle. Both have been very active in community development
efforts. We have also added a new committer, Kristopher Traquair in
recognition of the photographic work done during Apachecon NA in Montreal.
This is in line with our commitment to highlight that noncoding contributions
as well a coding contributions earn merit.

Events: We are continuing to be active in external events. During September we
participated at Solutions Hamburg and have several events coming up including
Codemotion in Madrid, Berlin and the Paris Open Source Summit.

Diversity Survey: It has been nearly two years since we ran the Committer
Diversity survey and have had discussions around re-running it. The community
has been very positive and many offers of help have been received to help with
review and support.

## Health report:
 - In our previous report there was some concern regarding not having enough
   volunteers to participate in the increased number of events we have been
   invited to. Fortunately we have found that new people are coming forward to
   volunteer to take on these co-ordination roles

-  Our monthly blog update has slipped and we are actively looking for people
   from the community to help provide content or help with putting it
   together.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 28 PMC members.
 - New PMC members:
    - Trevor Grant was added to the PMC on Wed Sep 26 2018
    - Ruth Suehle was added to the PMC on Wed Sep 26 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 29 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - Kristopher Traquair was added as a committer on Tue Oct 16 2018

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list traffic has increased over the quarter with a lot of active
   and interesting discussions. The increase could also be linked to the
   number of events we are participating in (e.g CFP notifications and event
   reminders)

  - dev@community.apache.org:
    - 869 subscribers (up 22 in the last 3 months):
    - 498 emails sent to list (344 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:

 - 8 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 4 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

#Status
Since the last report, 0.13 has been released. (Announcements and final
paperwork pending). Activity has been low on the project, but we still managed
6 votes (3 binding) over a 5 day period on the release.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

#Community
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC / Commit.


#Releases
Apache Rat 0.13 was released Nov 5th, 2018 Apache Rat  0.12 was released in
June, 2016 Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was
released in September, 2013.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
 - Quartz integration

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 We switched to Java8 as minimum requirement in DeltaSpike-1.9.0.
 There have been discussions about JavaEE 8 support, but nothing got
 decided yet.

## Health report:
 Health is basically fine but activity could of course be higher.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Chris Mattmann]

## Description:
- Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper around
  Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to complete on large
  code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The next steps are to make an RC1. Chris Mattmann will send a thread to the
   dev list and spend some time in the next few months putting this up.
 - Though activity has slowed a bit we have a functional Apache DRAT prototype
   working for the ASF (similar to a "Gump" style service) and are ready to
   roll an RC1.

## Health report:
 - We are ready for a 1.0 RC1. Chris Mattmann will volunteer to be the RM.
 - We expect some activity to pick up with 1.0 RC1.
 - In addition we also expect integration of the Avro integration work from
   Apache OODT (not a blocker to 1.0RC1 for DRAT) will also spurn some
   interest.
 - We did take feedback from Ted Dunning after standing up the Apache DRAT
   prototype on our VM and update the UI based on his feedback (you can now
   search by projects in the DRAT UI).
 - Ahmed our awesome GSOC 2018 student was added as a PMC member and
   committer.


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - Ahmed Ifhaam was added to the PMC on Thu Aug 30 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 14 committers.
 - Ahmed Ifhaam was added as a committer on Tue Aug 28 2018


## Releases:

 - Chris Mattmann will volunteer to be the RM for Apache DRAT 1.0. We slipped
   a little but are on target for a CY2018/1st Q 2019 release.

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list activity took a slight dip. Main reason I believe is that we
   are waiting to test and integrate Apache OODT 1.9-dev with the AvroRPC
   module in our code base. It's not a blocker to releasing 1.0 for Apache
   DRAT but I think Imesha is waiting for that to be tested. Mailing list
   activity will probably spike for a bit in the next quarter as we roll RC1
   for 1.0 Apache DRAT.

 - dev@drat.apache.org:
    - 16 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
  None on the horizon.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  This quarter there has been no activity on any Forrest mail list.

  At this report, two other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Idle
  3 people indicated presence: barely potential for sufficient oversight.

  Please see the detailed status notes for the June 2018 report.

  At that report a non-PMC member indicated that they intended to produce a
  release. During this past quarter (August-November) there has been no
  visible activity. The last action was my note to the dev list around
  7 August, explaining a wrinkle in the documented release process, and
  summarising some history about the last release. There was no follow-up.

  It seems that we should tread-water for a while longer, to give the best
  chance for this to happen.

Security issues published:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  None.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity was low in the last months. The most notable event was the donation
of a Maven plugin to the project from  Oath Inc., which we plan to generalize
further and release in the future. (The code base was given to the ASF
according to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-418. Required CCLA
and ICLA-s were received.)

## Health report:

Activity is relatively low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User
question (mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered
promptly. The short term goal is to release the next micro version (2.3.29) in
December. The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0
branch, so that the project can innovate and the code base can become much
cleaner (and more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by
15 years of historical baggage.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Releases:

 - 2.3.28 was released on Wed Apr 04 2018

   academic community: (i) one of them is the implementation of a new
   technique for storing the graph in a compressed form. This currently under
   review and has not been committed yet, (ii) a team of external
   collaborators have submitted the implementation of a new algorithm for
   review, (iii) I've asked another user to contribute a new algorithm
   implementation. This is still under discussion as to what algorithm to
   implement.
 - New release was delayed as I'd like to do some more cleanup, mostly get rid
   of old hadoop profiles, before this.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
 - The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
   open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
   Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
   extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
   standards.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The main focus this quarter has been put on releasing HTTPd with support
   for the latest OpenSSL (1.1.1) and thus TLS/1.3, as well as fixing up the
   test framework and miscellaneous supporting applications.
 - The project worked with Sally to promote the 2.4.37 release, highlighting
   the features mentioned in the previous bullet point. Save for a few snafus,
   the workflow with the new release automation we've been working on lately
   seems to be...flowing quite well :)

## Health report:
   While the commit activity remains on par with the previous quarter, the
   email activity, both in terms of senders and emails sent, have seen quite
   an uptick
   (22% each overall, 40%+ on dev@), while the number of topics went down
    (-17%) to roughly 200 topics discussed in this quarter. This is primarily
      explained by the focus on OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 upgrades to the
      httpd software, as well as extensive focus on the test framework and
      related tools.

   Looking at the slightly softer figures at our disposal, we see a steady
   continuation of the previous quarter (and indeed previous years), with a
   mostly fixed number of contributors and experience levels - a sort of
   neutral trend that could be interpreted either way. On one hand, we are
   doing well and retaining people that join the project. On the other hand,
   the level and speed of attracting new contributors have slowed down a bit.
   One can argue that this is a good thing (that we retain those that join),
   as well as argue that we could do more to attract new people to the
   project. My personal take is that the project is in good hands, but could
   start exploring how other projects have attracted people, should we feel
   this is needed in the near future. HTTPd has typically been a highly
   esteemed 'flagship project', and as such, one could argue that we have been
   complacent in our recruiting efforts...and while we do not appear to have
   suffered from this (that we know of), I believe it prudent to become more
   proactive in community outreach.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Activity:

The previous three months had 350 patches to the master branch, while this
three-month period had 330.

Prominent work in the last three months includes:

 - Support for multiple DISTINCT

 - The first Apache two-dot release (3.0.1) was made; normally we only do
   x.y.0 releases. This was done to fix two security issues.

 - Official CentOS support for developers.

 - A number of changes to make the C++ code have a reduced number of undefined
   behaviors.

 - Support for Hadoop's connector for Azure's new storage system,
   "Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2".

 - Multiple improvements in resource estimation and resource management.

 - Continued improvements in "local catalog" mode.

 - The addition of builtin JSON parsing functions.

 - Graceful node shutdown (with drain/quiesce).

## Health report:

The project remains healthy and metrics (number of commits, bugs filed, and
mailing list activity) remain healthy.

Four new contributors had patches committed.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 27 PMC members.
 - Joe McDonnell was added to the PMC on Mon Aug 20 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 44 committers.
 - Quanlong Huang was added as a committer on Thu Aug 23 2018

## Releases:

 - 3.0.1 was released on Tue Oct 23 2018

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing lists metrics that held steady:

 - user@: 83 emails sent in the past 3 months, 87 in the previous cycle.

Mailing list metrics that changed more:

 - dev@: 205 emails sent in the past 3 months, 299 in the previous cycle.
   There is no obvious immediate cause and this is likely just statistical
   fluctuation.

 - reviews@: 7312 emails sent in the past 3 months, 5638 in the previous
   cycle.

## JIRA activity:

 - 409 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months

 - 386 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Incubator PMC report for November 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of October,
podlings executed 4 distinct releases (a low number) and there are a couple 
of outstanding votes on releases for November. We added 3 new IPMC members.

Several podlings are heading towards graduation and several look like they 
may retire. ServiceComb and Joshua graduated last month and we will welcome 
several new podlings with votes or discussion underway for IotDB, Pinot, 
Sharding-Sphere, Brpc and Iceburg. Annotator had a discussion where they
decided not to retire. BatchEE still seems stuck in performing the last
graduation steps.

Doris is taking steps to address its lack of discussion on the mailing list 
and working on its first release.

MXNet had an excellent discussion around diversity and what it means to be 
a committer.

Superset is slowly addressing its issues, but has not yet made an Apache 
release and has continued to make unofficial releases. Its (new) mentor is 
helping out with this and it has pointed out if they don't try a little 
harder they may be removed from the incubator.

Unomi started graduation discussions, but run into some issues with PPMC 
members missing ICLAs and its roster. It may be that IP clearance still 
needs to be done.

Weex has improved with more discussion on the mailing list and discussion 
and action about how to improve community growth.

Skywalking put up a discussion to graduation, but it may of been too soon, 
given some irregularities with its roster and that they have only added one 
committer/PPMC member during incubation but have had a large number of 
contributions from many people.

Thanks to Edgenet for an honest and open assessment of where it is at.

Senssoft got a bit carried away and submitted a report when it didn't
need to. :-)

There were 6 IP clearances.

No podlings failed to report which is great to see.

The remaining missing mentors were contacted and those who didn't reply 
were removed from the podlings roster. We currently have about half of the 
podlings (23) with less than 3 mentors and 5 podlings only having one 
mentor. To get all podlings back to 3 mentors (which seems the ideal 
number) we would need 29 mentors volunteer. We're in the process of 
drafting an email to the members list, to see if we can get more members to 
step forward and become mentors. Several podlings have requested new 
mentors but so far we've only had a few IPMC members step forward and take 
on the role. (Podlings include Annotator, Dubbo, Hivemall, Superset and 
Warble).

In September several incubator PMC members visited China to speak at the 
Huawei Connect and COSCon'18 (where 3 different ASF incubator/Apache Ways 
talks were given). Many of the talks had moderate attendance but were 
streamed live to large numbers of people; one was live streamed to more than
1,000 people. Both conferences had ASF booths and we spoke to 100's of 
people and gave away countless ASF stickers, pamphlets and other swag.

IPMC and board members also visited several companies; Alibaba, Huawei and 
Tencent, to give talks, meet with developers contributing to ASF projects 
and meet with executives to find out how these companies and the ASF can 
work together. I was impressed to see Alibaba reached out to other people 
contributing to the Apache Dubbo project and invited them along to the 
meetings as well.

As a result of this a number of projects have a far better idea of how to 
operate as an Apache project and the steps towards graduation. We are 
likely to see several new (8-10) incubating projects arrive over the next 
few months.

Thanks to Huawei, Alibaba and Kaiyuanshe for making this possible. Thanks 
to Craig, Dave, Justin, Roman and Ross and others who gave up their time to 
do this and also many thanks to the many local people who helped out at the 
ASF booths, with translation of our talks and acting as guides to sometimes 
bewildered and slightly confused ASF people.

Several podlings have not kept their rosters up-to-date, and this has 
caused some graduation and access issues. Several of these podlings have 
been contacted and asked to correct their rosters and a couple have done 
so. The IPMC will keep an eye on podling reports and check that new 
committers/PPMC have been added to the roster, but it would be best if the 
podlings (and their mentors) take a more active role in doing this.

Some podlings are still having issues with creating initial accounts and 
signing ICLAs. A proof of concept system for easy ICLA signing was made by 
Daniel here https://icla.live/ .

What to do about podlings tasked with writing bylaws/guidelines is still 
outstanding.

DLab

DLab is a platform for creating self-service, exploratory data science
environments in the cloud using best-of-breed data science tools.

DLab has been incubating since 2018-08-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Execute the SGA between EPAM and the ASF so code can be imported.
  2. Move bug tracking system including project backlog to Apache issue 
  tracking system.
  3. Work toward an initial Apache release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing at this point of time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are not at the stage of building community so far.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Initial committers have submitted their Apache ICLA, subscribed to all 
 mailing lists and created Jira accounts. Functionality added:
  - Administrative Web UI for roles management
  - Fixed libraries installation for RStudio
  - Restrict usage of EC2 instances of certain shapes to different groups 
  of users
  - Fixed a bug on MS Azure when instance creation failed because of same 
  IP allocation to different instances
  - Added support of Dex authentication
  - Work in progress towards deployment into two VPC’s (SSN and Edge Node 
  into one VPC, notebooks and computational resources into separate VPC)
  - Work in progress implementing Java libraries support from WebUI

  Mentors were very responsive and provided a good overview of incubation 
  process in general. Helped a lot providing detailed instructions on how 
  to get subscribed, submit ICLA application and certainly provided a
  vector for next steps. The team has immediate support and can ask for
  any questions.

     Comments: To give some context regarding the mentor question above,
               I'm employed by the same company as the initial committers
               and have working with them since before the proposal to
               prep them for Apache.

               Currently we're waiting on the SGA (I'm working on pushing it
               through) which is blocking code import. Meanwhile the podling
               is starting to use the mailing list and populating JIRA.

               We discussed and this was corrected.
               More work is coming to the dev@ list and a new release is 
               being Voted on.
               Looking forward to more discussion on dev@.
               Next report should have a better discussion about steps to
               graduation.

Edgent

  Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
  that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
  local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
  from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
  all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
  conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
  efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
  center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Re-creating a working community
  2.  Re-populating the PPMC
  3.  Replenishing the group of mentors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  For the past months, there has been absolutely no activity in the project
  Even if there has been an occasional Email from an external entity in the
  last 3 months, the activity in the project has been solely me (Christofer)
  writing emails without getting any form of response from the rest of the
  committers, PPMCs or mentors

  The main problem here is, that when being voted into the project, I had
  been working on the build, but before I was able to start digging in the 
  code the rest of the team disappeared without me having had the chance to
  do a reasonably significant amount of know-how transfer. Currently, we
  have a codebase for which we have a detailed understanding of the build,
  but almost none of the code itself.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  *   Total, we have 82 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase of 5 
      since the last report.
  *   There have been two questions asked by users and two little 
      discussions about these issues on the list
  *   Discussions started on the private list have been left unresponded
  *   On 19th September 2018 Christofer had a talk about Apache Edgent on 
      the Solutions.Hamburg TechCamp

How has the project developed since the last report?

  *   According to JIRA, 0 new issue were added and none were resolved in 
      the last 90 days
  *   0 commits were made in the last 90 days.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After the withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members 
  currently a new committer, PPMC and mentor-base has to be built. Being
  working hard on the PLC4X podling, I am currently evaluating if I am
  going to be willing and able to achieve this goal.

  I just double checked, but it seems our mentors are not existent
  there had been one or two issues where feedback was explicitly

  Except Justin mentioning the absence of mentors.

Heron

A real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant stream processing engine.

Heron has been incubating since 2017-06-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Making the fist Apache Release. Vote for RC5 is currently on 
  general@incubator
  2. Making several Releases
  3. Continuing to grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

    Not at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been growing.  Two more monthly meetups have been 
  successfully organized so far after the initial one in April 2018.  We 
  have also seen more interests in the Heron from different channels and 
  getting more ideas from the community.  In October 2018 there was a
  presentation given at BazelCon in New York city on building Apache Heron.

How has the project developed since the last report?

    There have been mainly bug fixes and improvements to existing features.
    Some to note are
    * Works towards Apache release and five release candidates have been 
    created.
    * Updates for the licenses
    * Updates to the documentation
    * New integration tests
    * New designs/works for the Streamlet API(Heron’s high level DSL)

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Grow the community to have more activities.
 2. Grow more contributors and committers.
 3. Regular release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Activity on the dev and user mailing lists as well as the rate of reported
  JIRA issues has stayed steady. There has been an uptick of development
  activity around adding a new feature to the project (a Hive-compatible
  Thrift server implementation).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A new feature (Hive-compatible Thrift server) is being implemented and 
  support is being added for Apache Spark 2.4 release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 * No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The community has already migrated most of the infrastructure to
  Apache. After weeks of discussion, the community has finally come to a 
  consensus on the backlog for the first Apache release.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Code infrastructure is mostly migrated, new features are being 
  discussed.

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help
make the  web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and
bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The project needs more active developers.
  2. Create a first release
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The number of active developers is low. 
  It looks like we cannot leave this up to organic growth and would like to 
  brainstorm on ways to engage more developers.   

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new developer was proposed to be added as a committer, but nobody
  voted, so the vote failed. This vote may have been initiated too early.
  In terms of users the project seems to be growing slightly still, but in 
  terms  of developers we seem to be stalled.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A docker image for Alpine support was merged, which constitutes a non-
  trivial contribution.

  3. Expand committers and community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Weex

Weex is a framework for building high-performance mobile apps with modern
web development experience.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Propose more open discussions in the mailing list, improve the 
  activity.
  2. Establish a regular release schedule and a clear roadmap.
  3. Develop more committers and PPMCs, stay focused on the community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

  Apologize for missing the last podling report.

  The main reason for it is the PPMC and committers does not pay enough 
  attention in the mailing list. We have realized this mistake and decide 
  to take more efforts on building the community.

  Here are some actions:
  1. Hold meetings regularly among core contributors of Weex and publish 
  the summary to the mailing list.
  2. Take turns on duty for each release and podling reports.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  * Released a new version (v0.19.0) of Weex. 
  https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3e7bfe9e3f79a8d4b46dbe668bfb559e4e539
bd7c5f4143107e6af00@%3Cgeneral.incubator.apache.org%3E
  * Hold a meetup in Shanghai at 2018-09-15, discussed technologies about 
  the new render pipeline and interactive experience of Weex.
  * Migrate the source code from (git-wip-us.apache.org) to 
  (gitbox.apache.org) and enabled the issue panel on the GitHub.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * In average, more than 10 PRs or commits were merged to the main branch 
  each week. The Github repository now has 162 contributors (8 new since 
  the last report) and 1451 forks (130 new).
  * Weex has developed a new render pipeline and used it in production, but 
  it still needs more improvement.
  * A more CSS-friendly Weex Renderer is under discussing, it can fix many 
  cross-platform inconsistency problems.

     Comments: I met with Wenli in Shenzhen.
               None of the PPMC had subscribed to the private email list.
               We discussed and this was corrected.
               More work is coming to the dev@ list and a new release is 
               being Voted on.
               Looking forward to more discussion on dev@.
               Next report should have a better discussion about steps to
               graduation.

Edgent

  Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
  that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
  local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
  from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
  all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
  conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
  efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
  center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Re-creating a working community
  2.  Re-populating the PPMC
  3.  Replenishing the group of mentors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  For the past months, there has been absolutely no activity in the project
  Even if there has been an occasional Email from an external entity in the
  last 3 months, the activity in the project has been solely me (Christofer)
  writing emails without getting any form of response from the rest of the
  committers, PPMCs or mentors

  The main problem here is, that when being voted into the project, I had
  been working on the build, but before I was able to start digging in the 
  code the rest of the team disappeared without me having had the chance to
  do a reasonably significant amount of know-how transfer. Currently, we
  have a codebase for which we have a detailed understanding of the build,
  but almost none of the code itself.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  *   Total, we have 82 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase of 5 
      since the last report.
  *   There have been two questions asked by users and two little 
      discussions about these issues on the list
  *   Discussions started on the private list have been left unresponded
  *   On 19th September 2018 Christofer had a talk about Apache Edgent on 
      the Solutions.Hamburg TechCamp

How has the project developed since the last report?

  *   According to JIRA, 0 new issue were added and none were resolved in 
      the last 90 days
  *   0 commits were made in the last 90 days.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After the withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members 
  currently a new committer, PPMC and mentor-base has to be built. Being
  working hard on the PLC4X podling, I am currently evaluating if I am
  going to be willing and able to achieve this goal.

  I just double checked, but it seems our mentors are not existent
  there had been one or two issues where feedback was explicitly 
  asked for, but both the PPMC as well as all mentors remained silent.
  Except Justin mentioning the absence of mentors.

      Dave Fisher: If the project is to be rebooted then the PPMC needs to 
          be grown. 
          I think you might find at least one candidate from dev@ activity.
          Also I noticed a JIRA - EDGENT-450 about creating an Edge 
          Connector for Apache Pulsar. 
          I've sent a note to dev@pulsar suggesting they join at dev@edgent

Heron

A real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant stream processing engine.

Heron has been incubating since 2017-06-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Making the fist Apache Release. Vote for RC5 is currently on 
  general@incubator
  2. Making several Releases
  3. Continuing to grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

    Not at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been growing.  Two more monthly meetups have been 
  successfully organized so far after the initial one in April 2018.  We 
  have also seen more interests in the Heron from different channels and 
  getting more ideas from the community.  In October 2018 there was a
  presentation given at BazelCon in New York city on building Apache Heron.

How has the project developed since the last report?

    There have been mainly bug fixes and improvements to existing features.
    Some to note are
    * Works towards Apache release and five release candidates have been 
    created.
    * Updates for the licenses
    * Updates to the documentation
    * New integration tests
    * New designs/works for the Streamlet API(Heron’s high level DSL)

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help
make the  web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and
bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The project needs more active developers.
  2. Create a first release
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The number of active developers is low. 
  It looks like we cannot leave this up to organic growth and would like to 
  brainstorm on ways to engage more developers.   

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new developer was proposed to be added as a committer, but nobody
  voted, so the vote failed. This vote may have been initiated too early.
  In terms of users the project seems to be growing slightly still, but in 
  terms  of developers we seem to be stalled.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A docker image for Alpine support was merged, which constitutes a non-
  trivial contribution.

  3. Expand committers and community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  Chris Lambertus has moved from the PMC to a mentor role. This was done to 
  give us some redundancy in mentorship and Chris said his time would be 
  better spent in that role.

  2. Establish a regular release schedule and a clear roadmap.
  3. Develop more committers and PPMCs, stay focused on the community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

  Apologize for missing the last podling report.

  The main reason for it is the PPMC and committers does not pay enough 
  attention in the mailing list. We have realized this mistake and decide 
  to take more efforts on building the community.

  Here are some actions:
  1. Hold meetings regularly among core contributors of Weex and publish 
  the summary to the mailing list.
  2. Take turns on duty for each release and podling reports.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Hold a meetup in Shanghai at 2018-09-15, discussed technologies about 
  the new render pipeline and interactive experience of Weex.
  * Migrate the source code from (git-wip-us.apache.org) to 
  (gitbox.apache.org) and enabled the issue panel on the GitHub.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * In average, more than 10 PRs or commits were merged to the main branch 
  each week. The Github repository now has 162 contributors (8 new since 
  the last report) and 1451 forks (130 new).
  * Weex has developed a new render pipeline and used it in production, but 
  it still needs more improvement.
  * A more CSS-friendly Weex Renderer is under discussing, it can fix many 
  cross-platform inconsistency problems.

Zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed 
to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

Zipkin has been incubating since 2018-08-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Finalize the migration of the GitHub repositories
 2. Finalize the migration of website
 3. Assess the migration to Apache CI infrastructure (Jenkins)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The podling is presently blocked on INFRA-16989.

How has the community developed since the last report?
 
  The workshop has been held on 29th of October, 2018.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The team started to look at Apache CI infrastructure (Jenkins) and assess 
  the fit to the  project needs (comparing to Travis CI). The Zipkin web
  site has been already migrated to Jenkins job and automatically rebuilds
  in case of changes.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  The IP rights/SGA and Git repository migration are still ongoing.

  Mick was instrumental in getting us "in the nick of time" progressed on 
  the otherwise block on SGA. He encouraged me towards sending a message
  to the secretary and escalated later which allowed a last minute progress.

  Andriy helped with keeping spirit alive on dev list, review of wiki 
  content and also progressed our new committer Raja towards steps needed
  for committership.

     Comments: I would have listed the blockage on migrating the code 
     (INFRA-16989) under "issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF
     Board wish/need to be aware of" as even though it's moving again,
     this podling has barely moved for months because of it.
  [X](zipkin) John D. Ament
     Comments: I agree with the issues around the code import and don't 
     understand how we can help them move past it.  It seems that infra has 
     suddenly put a burden on secretary that isn't typical.
  [X](zipkin) Willem Ning Jiang
     Comments: As we already get iCLAs and SGA, can we move the code in to 
     Apache?

     Comments:  The project struggles for a few months now to get the SGA 
     approved or/and accepted 
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-16989)
     by Apache. This is a significant source of frustration among the PPMCs 
     and community in general as the any further efforts are blocked.

  The community has been:

  -discussing reaching out to other open source projects to identify other 
  potential  communities (analytical technologies) to drive developments,
  as well as increase interest in the Podling.
  -discussing research applications with university research labs in 
  machine learning and social computing.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

## Description:

 - jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
   Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification
   for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an

## Activity:

 -  jUDDI - last release was 22 NOV 2017. Some development has taken place
    since then related maintenance and updating dependencies.

## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in
   all likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

 - These errors are for older versions of jUDDI in which a former PMC's gpg
   key expired. The key has been refreshed however the previous releases will
   probably not be resigned.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We are voting on the next major release 2.1.0.  This release includes 28 new KIPs
and features such as Java 11 support, Zstandard support, more intuitive user 
timeouts in the producer, better fencing for replication, various Streams API 
improvements and the admin client improvements.

We released 2.0.1, which fixes 49 issues.

Community 
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2767 subscribers in the user
mailing list, up 28 in the last 3 months. We have 864 emails in the user
mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 953 in the previous
cycle. We have 1259 subscribers in the dev mailing list, up 45 in the last 3
months. We have 2972 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit 
more than the 2878 in the previous cycle.

We elected two new committers, Colin McCabe on Sep 29, 2018 and Manikumar Reddy
on Oct 11, 2018. We elected one new PMC member Dong Lin on Aug. 4, 2018.

Kafka Summit in San Francisco completed with more than 1200 attendees.

We published the very first Kafka blog in Apache
(https://blogs.apache.org/kafka/entry/apache-kafka-supports-more-partitions).

Releases
===========
2.0.1 was released on Nov. 9, 2018.
1.1.1 was released on Jul. 20, 2018.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and visualizing
activity in software projects. http://kibble.apache.org/

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity and health

We had another quiet quarter. There was some discussion of participating in
the upcoming CHAOSS summit at FOSDEM, and a handful of commits.

Some off-list conversations were had at various events, including Open Source
Summit in Edinburgh, with individuals who expressed interest in the project.
These have not translated into actual project engagement.

It is concerning that *ALL* commits in this quarter (indeed, much longer than
that) have been from one person. This is, obviously, not the hallmark of a
sustainable project.

## PMC/Committer changes:

Currently 12 committers and 12 PMC members.
No new PMC members in the last 3 months.
Last PMC addition: Sat Dec 09 2017 (Rafael Weingärtner)
No new committers in the last 3 months.
Last committer addition: Sat Dec 09 2017 (Rafael Weingärtner)

## Releases:

We have not yet made a release.

## Mailing list activity:

Another quiet month on all of our mailing lists. We hope that discussions at
FOSDEM will once again spark some interest, and new contributors.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.11.0 release on
September 30, 2018.  The next major release is scheduled for December 31,
2018.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did
not sign up any new committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the lookout
for new PMC members and committers.  There are several candidates at this time
but we have not yet held a vote for committership.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been very active this quarter.  Much of the
communication has been related to support and installation debugging. 
Development has involved numerous enhancement requests, and work integrating
updates to Tika and SolrJ.  Our release had to be delayed to synch with
Tika's, and SolrJ was particularly challenging this time because changes there
broke long-standing capabilities we had relied upon.  The SolrJ team has now
begun a healthy discussion about how to officially support the ManifoldCF use
case going forward.

Issues reported have been centered mainly on bugs and on GSOC students this
quarter.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since 2016-10.

-- Activity --

Another report similar to the last few, and late as well. I'd like to provide
a great explanation as to the reason for this, but I have a somewhat difficult
time to find one. It's honestly somewhat difficult for me to keep up with a
project that is quiet like we've been for a while now.

I believe the board has rasons to be concerned about the health of this
project, but I am not sure what a good plan going forward could be.

It's not that the project is dead, in my opinion, more like dormant. It works,
it's being used by a large number of users, and is extremely stable.

The current development resources towards new features is pretty low, however,
that's for certain. I, for one, don't really do much more than keep an eye on
the mailing-lists for troubling bug reports, but otherwise, that's about it.

Regarding the active PMC members, I don't want to talk for anybody, but I
suspect the situation is similar all around. The product/project just works
and there are opportunities for new feature development, but there doesn't
seem to much push for that either.


I am not sure what could be done at the moment to change that state of
affairs, really, short of having a sudden infusion of interest and development
cycles.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members.

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

   CA to be a general community-driven discussion. Notes will be taken and
   posted to the dev-list for those unable to join physically and remotely.
 - We've not added any new committers or PMC, but do have on-going discussions

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## XMLBeans update plans
 - As the main reason for bringing XMLBeans back from the attic was to get rid
   of some hurdles when using it in Apache POI, our focus for XMLBeans will be
   on bugfixes and updating technology support, e.g. security fixes, newer
   version of Java and other dependencies.

   Apache POI will remain our main focus for new development work, while
   XMLBeans is for us mostly in "bugfix-mode" as a large amount of Apache POI
   code depends on XMLBeans..

   We will continue to refine how we present this on xmlbeans.apache.org so
   that other users of XMLBeans know what to expect.

   For mailing lists we redirect questions to the Apache POI users/dev lists.

   For issues we continue to use the issues.apache.org project for XMLBEANS
   and Bugzilla for Apache POI.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We finally released Apache POI 4.0.0, which was received quite well
   considering the amount of changes and refactorings that went into that
   release.

   A few smaller regressions were found, a follow-up fix-release 4.0.1 should
   be available soon.

   Also XMLBeans 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 were released, both with a small amount of
   changes, mostly XML parsing/security related fixes.

   We continue to update the XMLBeans homepage to reflect the new
   maintainership via the Apache POI PMC.

   Java 11 is supported in latest trunk, the changes will be released in the
   upcoming version 4.0.1.

   One new Committer/PMC member was voted in, but did not follow up on the
   invitation yet.

## Health report:
 - There was some discussion of bug reports/features via bugzilla and a number
   of requests which indicate that the popularity of Apache POI is still very
   good. Questions via email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Bug influx was moderate this quarter, however also bug-fix rate is not very
   high, probably most "easy wins" are already resolved now and thus mostly
   hard to fix bug-repports remain.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode and was re-activated only a short while ago.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:

 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
   network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
   while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
   proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

- No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work modular build structure has
    commenced, awaiting to be populated with River 3.0 code.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release) River 3.2 - Input
validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling& safe ServiceRegistrar 
lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer
   to peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has
   the potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced
   with IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
     Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
     service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to
     secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - There was one new release over the last quarter. Version 2.0.2 of the
   XML Security for C++ project was released. This patch corrects a bug that
   can cause crashes in upstream applications. 

   Some ongoing work has also taken place on a new major release of the Java
   library, which is expected in a few weeks.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC.

   We added the first new committer and PMC member in many years over the 
   last quarter (Dan Kulp).

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
base of the SIS library is modelled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity and Health report:

SIS 0.8 release was one year ago. We have about 15 tasks scheduled for
1.0 release [1], most of them being regressions not yet fixed,
compatibility with Java 11 not yet verified, conformance with some
international standards not yet verified. Currently, Apache SIS is
getting new features during work days - those features were not
requirements for 1.0 releases - but work on the tasks scheduled for 1.0
release can be done only during weekends. This make difficult to predict
when those tasks will be completed. At this time, we wish to fix at
least the regressions before a release.

The Google Summer of Code has been completed successfully, but
integration of this work is planed only after SIS 1.0 release. Small
contributions from a San-Fransisco student also occurred during summer
and stopped after university resumed.

A talk on SIS and geospatial API for the cloud has been done during the
geospatial track in Montréal ApacheCon with about 30 attendees in the
room. Interesting discussions happened after the presentation (how to
balance standardization and the habits of various user communities,
applications to aeronautic, connection with Apache Calcite, addition of
"geospatial", "machine learning" and "internet of things" categories for
Apache projects) [2]. A similar talk will be presented on December 6th
at Paris Open Source Summit 2018 [3]. Geospatial API were also discussed
in September at the Open Geospatial Consortium meetings [4].

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We released Apache Spark 2.4.0 on Nov 2nd, 2018 as our newest feature
  release. Spark 2.4's features include a barrier execution mode for machine
  learning computations, higher-order functions in Spark SQL, pivot syntax in
  SQL, a built-in Apache Avro data source, Kubernetes improvements, and
  experimental support for Scala 2.12, as well as multiple smaller features
  and fixes. The release notes are available at
  http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-4-0.html.

- We released Apache Spark 2.3.2 on Sept 24th, 2018 as a bug fix release for
  the 2.3 branch.

- Multiple dev discussions are under way about the next feature release, which
  is likely to be Spark 3.0, on our dev and user mailing lists. Some of the
  key questions are which JDK, Scala, Python, R, Hadoop and Hive versions to
  support, as well as whether to remove certain deprecated APIs. We encourage
  everyone in the community to give feedback on these discussions through the
  mailing lists and JIRA.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- Nov 2nd, 2018: Spark 2.4.0
- Sept 24th, 2018: Spark 2.3.2

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is healthy and active. New features are being designed
  and developed, and bug reports are being handled. Our user support
  forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers regularly.

  Our last committer additions happened in October 2017:
    Pavel Lyalyakin who has been contributing to the project's website.
    Troy Curtis Jr who has been contributing to SVN's Python 3 bindings.

* Releases

  We have released Subversion 1.10.3 on October 10 2018, and
  Subversion 1.11.0 on October 30 2018.

  The current supported releases are 1.9.9, 1.10.3, and 1.11.0.

* The PMC was formally enquired by the European Commission regarding
  the merger of Microsoft and GitHub.  The RFI was responded to by the
  Chairman.

* Delayed patching of known security issues 

  The developer base keeps prioritizing other work over known security
  problems. The Apache Security team keeps sending us occasional
  reminders about problems which got CVE numbers assigned to them
  but have no public fix yet after months of being reported.
  Part of the problem is that our active developer base is shrinking.
  Some outstanding work on security issues was begun by developers
  who appear to have since become inactive.

  The status of outstanding known security issues is documented below.

  ^/pmc/subversion/security/CVE-2018-1293
  Per recommendation by the Apache Security team, this problem is now
  being treated as a non-security issue.
  The impact is a DoS which can only be triggered by an authenticated
  attacker, and is easily resolved with 'svn rm'. Also, the work
  required for a fix is not trivial so development on a public branch
  will be easier than mailing patch files around. A fix is now being
  developed in public: https://svn.apache.org/r1846391

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]


## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Activity

Activity has started to climb on the project with work on adding more
MicroProfile compliance into TomEE.  MicroProfile JWT was added as discussed
in the last two board reports and was the only support for those periods.  On
Sep 7th the project released a new branch of TomEE, called 7.1, which is
TomEE 7 + MicroProfile 1.x on Java 8.  This release adds MicroProfile Config
and MicroProfile FaultTolerance, both using the Geronimo implementations.

The master branch switched from TomEE 7 to the future TomEE 8 and a milestone
release of TomEE 8 was completed Oct 19th.  The release contains Java EE 8
work which had been ongoing for a long period of time, plus MicroProfile
Health Check, MicroProfile Metrics, MicroProfile Rest Client and MicroProfile
Open API bringing the total number of MicroProfile specifications supported
to 7.  The Geronimo implementations were used for all these integrations.

A maintenance release of TomEE 7.0.5 was completed July 24th and consists of
bug fixes, minor dependency upgrades and patched security vulnerabilities.

Nominated by Mark Struberg, the project voted in new committer Roberto Cortez
on Sep 6th for his contributions to the project's MicroProfile efforts and
releases. Discussions on other new potential committers are in progress, also
started by Mark.

Committer Jonathan Fisher who had been voted in last year, but never
completed his CLA and account has now gone through the process and officially
