 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we continued some important discussions on where we are
       going as a foundation, how we are going to operate and how Officers
       and Directors should represent the foundation externally.  We
       continued slow progress on the 5-year plan update.  My hope is that in
       the coming month, we will make enough progress that as we enter budget
       planning for the next fiscal year, we will have consensus views on
       what our priorities are and we can use the draft plan update as a
       guide in making budget decisions.

       This month we received very good reports from Beam, Incubator, Olingo
       and Pulsar.  PMC chairs and other interested community members are
       encouraged to look at these reports as examples of the kinds of things
       we like to see in project reports. Comments this month focused on the
       usual topics, reminding PMCs to discuss issues that we had seen on
       private or dev lists, keeping things that can be public public, and
       making sure that synchronous meetings get reported back to public
       lists.

       Best wishes to all for a joyous holiday season and many, many thanks
       to all whose volunteer efforts have made this a great year for the
       ASF!

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall, we continue to be significantly under budget in expenditures,
       and ahead of plan in terms of income.

       Brand Management is operating normally, and Finance has been quiet.

       While I expect most areas input to to the upcoming five year plan to
       be incremental changes, this will not be the case for Fundraising
       where the team has been building an entirely new plan.  Expect a draft
       of that plan to be posted to board@, most likely by the end of the
       year.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on Nov 30th, 2018 was $2,205.9K, which is up  $36.4K
       from last month's ending balance (Oct 18) of $2,169.5K.    Total Cash
       as of Nov 30th, 2018 is $3,599.8K ( includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation) as compared to $1,611.7K on Nov 30th 2017. The
       Nov 2018 ending Operating cash balance of $2,205.9K represents an
       Operating cash reserve of 14 months based on the FY19 conservative
       Cash forecast average monthly spending of $157.4K/month.  The ASF
       actual Operating reserve  of 14 months at the end of Nov 2018 is ahead
       of the budgeted 10.5 month reserve for YTD through Nov 2018.  The ASF
       Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of
       the ASF' s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income,  was ahead of FY 18, at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $12.2K .  As compared to the FY 19
       Budgeted Income,  YTD,  we are ahead by $345.3K.

       YTD expenses, through Nov 30th, 2018 are under budget by $254.1K.  All
       depts. are under budget, at the end of Nov 2018.  There are still a
       couple items worth mentioning, one being Infra,  as noted in the Board
       summary is $141.4K under budget due to the timing of hiring of staff
       and not having to pay any Lease web invoices YTD.  The other being TAC
       at $45K under budget YTD for FY19.  We have moved most of the dept
       underspending forward in the Cash forecast and will be reviewing the
       underspending with the departments as we move forward in FY19 Q3.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $135.9K NI vs a budgeted negative <$463.5K> NI or $599.4K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments offset by more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in all depts
       YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are doing very
       well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking
       timing variances into account.  We will continue to monitor this as we
       move further into FY19.  With regard to FY18, we are outpacing revenue
       but are also out pacing expenses ($230.2K), and therefore trailing NI
       year over year, by $-218K, but again significantly ahead of FY19
       budget in all categories.

       Infrastructure
       =============

       Infrastructure is operating as expected.

       Hiring remains a focus - there are many resumes to review.

       GitBox migration is now active. Migration is currently voluntary, but
       the expectation that it will become mandatory has been set. There is
       currently no date upon which migration becomes mandatory.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Sally continues to handle sponsor outreach and renewal activities.
       $593K secured in annual renewals thus far (excludes multi-year
        invoicing/payments).

       Individual Giving campaign launched
       (https://s.apache.org/9cCy) during the Giving Tuesday global movement.
        745 individuals donated nearly $80K since the program's launch last
        year.

       Q2 FY2019  quarterly report has also been published
       https://s.apache.org/d2Fq .

       Conferences
       ===========

       Planning to open ACNA19 CFP in January.

       Projects are invited to run their own
       mini-conference/track/summit/other as we continue our march towards
       ApacheCon being a convention of project conferences. 6 projects or
       topic communities have responded so far.

       ACEU19 planning has resumed, Myrle Krantz is leading the effort. The
       event will be held in Berlin at the Kulturbrauerei.

       The DC Roadshow (lead Kevin McGrail) has been rescheduled for Monday,
       March 25th, 2019. We hope to re-launch promotion for this event soon.

       Chicago Roadshow (lead Trevor Grant) on schedule for May 13-14 2019,
       in Logan Square.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       No report submitted at the time of writing. However, I am aware of a
       conversation regarding the provision of funds for a specific minority
       group. Initially the TAC rejected this on the grounds that the
       committee and process is not setup to allow such targeting. However, a
       proposal has been made that would appear to add no significant
       overhead on the TAC community and preserves the existing evaluation
       criteria. This is still under consideration.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues well financially.

Our monthly committee meetings continue and our next meeting is on the 10th of
January and guests are welcome.

Financially, we continue to add more sponsors and fundraising goals are being
met or exceeded.  With being under budget, gaining more sponsors and some
early sponsor payments, we are now $600K ahead of budget based on Net Income
for the Fiscal Year to Date with 10.5 months of reserves in our operating
accounts plus additional monies from Pineapple and the restricted donation
earmarked for the endowment.

An initial prospectus for ApacheCon EU 2019 was sent and we are currently
working on verbals for 4 platinum sponsors.  Fundraising for ApacheCon EU 2019
and a Roadshow Event in Chicago as well as a combined event in Spain is also
under way.  The DC Event has a new date of March 25th.

We encourage you to visit http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html and
thank our sponsors any time the opportunity arises.  As a charity, we rely
completely on their altruism.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - December 2018

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule, with no vendor payments
outstanding.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues Sponsor outreach and
renewal activities, with $593K secured in annual renewals thus far (excludes
multi-year invoicing/payments). The annual Individual Giving campaign launched
https://s.apache.org/9cCy during the Giving Tuesday global movement. 745
individuals donated nearly $80K since the program's launch last year. The
latest "Success at Apache" post, "Cookie Monster", is live at
https://s.apache.org/cnSe . The Q2 FY2019  quarterly report has also been
published https://s.apache.org/d2Fq .

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 230 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 12 items, and have 51K followers on
Twitter, following the bot purge adjustment. We also hit a technical snag the
weekend before the "Individual Giving" campaign where Twitter's algorithms
caused our account to be shut down. Thanks to assistance from Jim Jagielski,
Saša Gargenta, Remy DeCausemaker, Ignasi Barrera, and Mohammad Almalkawi, our
account was restored just in time for Giving Tuesday. In addition, We posted 8
items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 43.4K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 4 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 2 media queries. The ASF received 1,385
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,236. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 2,955 press hits vs. last month's 3.024. ApacheCon received 2
press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 3 analyst queries during this time. Apache
was mentioned in 4 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 2 reports by
451 Research; and 3 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: planning for promotional materials, creative assets, and
Website refresh for the ASF's 20th Anniversary is underway. Sally created
high-resolution graphics for a print article in JAX Magazine, as well as
supporting images for a keynote presentation for Flink Forward China. The
images were generated by the analytics provided by Snoot.

IX. Events liaison: no third party events are planned at this time, however,
we are beginning to work with Virtual on ApacheCon North America 2019 and
newthinking for ApacheCon Europe 2019. Sally worked with ASF Secretary Craig
Russell on securing and creating his keynote presentation for Flink Forward
China, as well as the conference producers to ensure that they were in
compliance with the ASF’s policies on Apache project brand usage.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 4 pre-paid press releases remaining in our
contract with GlobeNewswire, which will auto-renew through December 2019.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Move from HipChat over to Slack. We are signed into both platforms,
  but much of our day-to-day work is still on HipChat.
- Perform a Jenkins/plugins upgrade.
- Hire new people.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move to new email infrastructure.

General Activity
================
- GitBox migration is now active. Projects have been told they "must"
  move eventually, and we're taking volunteers right now. Each
  community can vote when a move is best for them, and we will migrate
  them. When the flow of volunteers slows, we'll put out another call
  and/or suggest a deadline when we'll perform a mandatory migration.
- Reviewing a huge number of resumes.
- Continued movement to rsync-based backups, so we can avoid paying
  for a Zmanda license in January.
- The AOO wiki and forums have been migrated to new cloud hardware
  (away from our VMware hosts at OSU/OSL), newer software, and the old
  stuff has been decommissioned.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ACNA19

This month we have made good progress towards ApacheCon North America
2019. Meetings have started with our producer. We are hoping to open
the CFP in January, as we're waiting for a new version of the CFP
system from our vendor.

We reached out to projects to offer them the opportunity to run their
own mini-conference, track, summit, or whatever they choose to call
it, as part of our event, as we continue our march towards ApacheCon
being a convention of project conferences. We have received requests
from 6 projects or topic communities, plus at least one which is
discussing it on their mailing list. Once we have a track/room grid
documented, we'll begin slotting these into the available space.

ACEU19

Meetings have resumed with our producer for ApacheCon Europe 2019.
Myrle Krantz is leading that effort, and is working with our producer
to nail down details. The event will be held in Berlin at the
Kulturbrauerei where we held our 2018 EU event.

DC Roadshow

The DC Roadshow has been rescheduled for Monday, March 25th, 2019. We
hope to re-launch promotion for this event soon.

Kevin McGrail is the lead for that event.

Chicago Roadshow

Trevor Grant continues to work towards a 2019 Roadshow in Chicago, May
13-14 2019, in Logan Square. Look for more details in the next month
or two.

Nothing to report this month.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

Legal Affairs committee for the past month has been mostly business as usual
with an average number of LEGAL jiras coming in and requiring our attention.
Assistant V.P., Legal Affairs and other members of a legal committee have been
doing excellent job at triaging legal JIRAs and making sure we make progress
on addressing our backlog. We are currently at 24 open (compared to 22 last
month) JIRAs  with the oldest dating back to Jan 2017.

VP Brand Management did a really great job keeping committee posted on latest
developments around Common Clause and also keeping our pro-bono counsel in the
loop. There's currently no updates to be shared aside from what is already
reflected on: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-402

There's been an active discussion among Legal Committee members about what
configuration of mailing lists and aliases which would best satisfy the goal
of rigorously upholding attorney client privilege.  Consensus on the best
course of action has not yet emerged.

Another useful discussion around official status of convenience binary
releases in the foundation appears to have converged and we hope to suggest

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.9 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

This past quarter most if not all of the Jira issues created were because of
upgrades to new Axis2 versions and JDK upgrades.

Most of our users are using legacy SOAP services, to attract new committers
work has started on an 'auto configuration module' for spring boot, which
supplies a pom.xml for deps and programmatic initialization of REST based JSON
services if the axis2 jar is detected.

Axis2 C added a new committer, Bill Blough, this past December 2017 and so far
that is helping the project pick up speed. There wwa more progress via commits
and Jira issues this past quarter. Its been a decade since the last release
and while he has no ETA on the next one, the commits and resolved Jira issues
indicate that he is making good progress.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
 - Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming
   data processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed
   execution engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to
   different technologies and user communities.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We are happy to welcome a new integration: A Beam runner for Apache Nemo
   (incubating) has been authored, and resides in the Nemo repository.
 - The community held a 2-day Beam Summit London in October with 80 attendees,
   mostly users. Considered a success, the community intends to hold more,
   likely planning a bit more in advance.

 - The project has also added a “Roadmap” to the website, to share with users
   exciting developments underway that are otherwise only discoverable on
   dev@. Based on a good discussion, it emphasizes how a roadmap for a
   community driven ASF project differs from a commercial roadmap.

 - Other recent community decisions include:
   - Releasing “vendored” artifacts as an alternative to shading, much as
     Apache Flink does.
   - Clarifying the conditions under which Beam’s “rollback first” policy
     applies. Notably, it does not apply to downstream (potentially
     non-public) integrations.
   - Send Jira and Jenkins notifications to separate lists issues@ and
     builds@, respectively.
   - Previously, the community agreed to establish a long-term support (LTS)
     branch. This quarter, the 2.7 minor release family was chosen for a 6
     month pilot.

 - IP clearance has been completed for:
   - Dataflow Java Worker

## Health report:
 - Notable this quarter is greatly increased attention to the website and wiki
   pages pertaining to onboarding new contributors.
 - The dev@ and user@ mailing lists continue the prior modest linear growth
   trend.
 - Email volume to dev@ has increased markedly, especially noting that we have
   rerouting all automated emails to issues@beam.apache.org and
   builds@beam.apache.org.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 19 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Thomas Weise on Fri Jun 08 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 46 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - David Morávek was added as a committer on Mon Oct 29 2018
    - Ankur Goenka was added as a committer on Mon Oct 22 2018
    - Matthias Baetens was added as a committer on Mon Nov 26 2018
    - Xinyu Liu was added as a committer on Mon Oct 15 2018

## Releases:

 - Since the last report, Apache Beam has published two releases, with one
   more currently in progress:
   - 2.7.0 was released on Fri Sep 28 2018
   - 2.8.0 was released on Thu Oct 25 2018
   - 2.9.0 is in progress

 - The community determined to start the release process every 6 weeks, and we
   have stuck to this. The smaller gap between 2.7.0 and
  2.8.0 is due to variance in the time to a final RC.

## Mailing list activity:

    - 575 subscribers (up 28 in the last 3 months):
    - 1939 emails sent to list (1937 in previous quarter)

## Apache BVal Report December 2018 ##

 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
   the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - During the past quarter we released Apache BVal 2.0.0 which delivers an

 - The recent release included code that, unless deliberately circumvented,
   would prevent the behavior at the core of the security vulnerability reported
   during Q2.
 - The Bean Validation EG leadership has reached out to encourage us to obtain
   official status as a conforming implementation. This is primarily a matter
   of configuration tooling which we hope to address in a forthcoming point
   release.
 - We have received a small number of post-release bug reports which we intend
   to address in the immediate future when the team's non-volunteer workload
   permits.

## Health report:

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Eagle Project  [Edward Zhang]

## Description:
 - Apache Eagle is an open source analytics solution for identifying security
and performance issues instantly on big data platforms.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - In Eagle dev mail list, an architecture improvement discussion was raised 
which is about removing some existing components but focusing on alert policy
engine and some important data adaptors. The goal is to make Eagle to be 
developed and used more easily. It may take some time to finish the discussion.

## Health report:
 - Auto generated health score seems low. It could be due to no much commits or 
jira issues which were created recently. Once after PMC/Committers have some agreement
on architecture improvements, the community activity should be back to normal.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community has released the 1.7 release, with features such
    as support for Scala 2.12, enhancements to Streaming SQL, Complex Event
    processing, AWS S3, connectors, and recovery.

  - The project has entered a phase of many discussions about breaking
    changes and consolidation of batch and streaming APIs to fix some
    shortcomings and technical complexity, due to the way the project evolved
    organically over time.

  - In the area of Streaming SQL, there is a fruitful collaboration with the
    Apache Calcite project, which resulted for example in new streaming joins
    and an integration of complex event processing and SQL.

  - The program for the Flink Forward Beijing conference is available. Aside
    from tech talks, there will be a keynote by Craig Russell about the ASF
    and how to contribute to Apache projects.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

{{{
Incubator PMC report for December 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of November,
podlings executed 11 distinct releases. We added 17 new IPMC members and 
had 2 IPMC members retire.

Several podlings are heading towards graduation. We have also have several 
new podlings with IotDB, Sharding Sphere, BRPC and Iceburg join our ranks 
and two podlings Quickstep and ODF toolkit retire. ODF toolkit had spent 7 
years in the incubator. Airflow look set to graduate and will be the 200th 
active Apache project if no other TLP projects retire. BatchEE still seems 
stuck in performing the last graduation steps.

Superset is slowly addressing its issues, but has still not made an Apache 
release and has continued to make unofficial releases. A meeting has been 
set up to try and sort out the issues as discussing them on the mailing 
list doesn't seem to be working.

There were 2 IP clearances.

A number of podlings, despite prompting, failed to report and will be asked 
to report next month.

The mentor situation has improved but we still have a number of podlings 
(19) with less than 3 mentors.

An email was sent to the members list, to see if we can get more IPMC 
members and several people stepped forward.

We also had a discussion about lowering the bar for IPMC members and seeing 
how they potential candidates can be more easily recognised. While unusual
at the  ASF, we've asked people to self identify, they will still be voted 
on by the IPMC, and several have come forward and have been voted in. 
Several had more than enough merit and had gone unnoticed or looked over
by the IPMC and in a couple of cases were extremely obvious candidates.

As a result of both of these we have 17 new IPMC members and several new 
mentors.

One podling had to be reminded that a NOTICE needs to be sent to the IPMC 
for any new PPMC members.

Moderators of the incubator mailing list had gone missing and 3 new 
moderators have been added. Some IPMC members had previously missed being 
signed up the private email list as a result of this.

A large number (100+) of IPMC members are not signed up to the private mail 
list, each was sent emails asking them to sign up. A couple asked to be 
removed from IPMC but the majority of those contacted have not signed up. 
There's probably not much more that can be done about this.

Podlings rosters are now (with a few exceptions) mostly up-to-date.

The default podling bylaws/guidelines were posted to the board list, some 
minor changes were made and have been accepted. Graduating podlings will be 
pointed to these guidelines rather than encouraged to write their own.

BRPC

BRPC is an industrial-grade RPC framework for building reliable and 
high-performance services.

BRPC has been incubating since 2018-11-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Collect the SGA and ICLAs of the Initial COmmitters
  2. Create the Mailing Lists and Subscribe
  3. Move the Repository under Apache.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Just getting started. A little slowness on the Mentor / Champion side on 
  the setup.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  First report.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
    Dave Fisher: I wrote up this report and made the mailing list request.
    Justin Mclean: LDAP and DNS also feel between the cracks. Mentors were
    pinged but no response. I think it would be good for this project to
    have an extra mentor.

--------------------
Crail

Crail is a storage platform for sharing performance critical
data in distributed data processing jobs at very high speed.

Crail has been incubating since 2017-11-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Community building: attract additional contributors from different
     companies/affiliations
  2. Further increase visibility / PR
  3. Develop further fields of applicability of Crail, such as
     efficient serverless computing

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

     Comments: It's taken a few iterations, but the first release looks like
       it's just about to pass the vote. This was their biggest hurdle. They
       mastered Apache governance a long while ago, and have built 
       community.
       I'm not concerned about the weekly sync up meetings as long as they
       continue to send out minutes and make decisions on the dev list.
       After one more release this project should consider graduation.
  [x](druid) P. Taylor Goetz
     Comments: I agree with Julian. Though would recommend (but not demand)
       three releases prior to graduation.

     I am happy to see that Julian is gently steering them to use dev@

     They have made non-Apache releases, but are now on rc4 of an 
     Apache release.

Iceberg

Iceberg is a table format for large, slow-moving tabular data.

Iceberg has been incubating since 2018-11-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  2. Finish the name clearance.
  3. Make the first Apache release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Gitbox integration has helped a lot, although it is frustrating that
    the team members are not allowed to configure the project and must go
    through infra for every change.
  * The traffic on the dev list from Github pull requests and issues is 
    pretty heavy. It would be nice to have emails from creation go to dev@,
    while updates and resolutions would go the issues@.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  New committer, Yonatan Gottesman, was added to Omid’s community. Yonatan 
  is very active and contributed to the integration with Phoenix. 
  Moreover, Yonattan implemented the low latency version of Omid which is 
  currently part of release 1.0.0.
  Integration with Apache Phoenix will be ready in a few days, early 
  December.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The vote for major release 1.0.0 passed successfully in the incubator 
  general list. This release includes all the Phoenix required features. 
  The release is currently being deployed to Nexus and a formal 
  announcement of the release will be send shortly.
  Omid and Apache Phoenix integration is at its final stage. Omid release 
  1.0.0 includes all Phoenix required features, therefore, from the Omid 
  side, the integration with Phoenix is over. 
  The Phoenix code is also ready and currently located in a feature branch 
  that will be merged in a few days.

  Drew Farris (Shepherd) - Mentors active on the mailing lists, active 
  development, and progress towards graduation observed.

--------------------
OpenWhisk  
OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able 
to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) 
from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional 
logic (Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST 
API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support 
packaging and catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to 
host the platform components as Docker containers on various Container 
Frameworks such as Mesos, Kubernetes, and Compose.
 
OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:    
   1. Improve release automation to decrease manual steps in creating 
   release artifacts.
      a. Release process/automation/documentation are here 
https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release).
      b. We have made the initial releases of 12 core software components.  
  In the process we have developed some release automation, but there is a 
   need to further automate the process and formalize the mechanisms for 
make 
   a coordinated release of all components.
   2. Increase additional company and individual Contributors to maintain 
   all project repos. and address Issue / PR backlog.
   3. Close legal transferred of Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and 
   logo to ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?    
   1. Issue backlog building on incubator-openwhisk is still a major issue 
  (partly due to #2 above). As of this report, the "open" issue backlog on 
  the "main" platform repo is 397 (up from 384 as of last report). The open 
  PR count on the main repo has held steady at around 30 (down from 50+ 6 
  months ago), but still 1/3 of the ready-to-merge PRs are more than 1 
  month old.  The PR and Issue backlog on other project repositories is
  generally much lower and of less concern than the Issue backlog on the
  main repo.
   2. Need to prioritize and work to reduce while advancing major proposals 
  around restructuring around abstractions to accommodate running on 
  Knative while enhancing support for better logging/scheduling and
  performance testing enhancements.
   3. Trying to add more active Committers to augment those who have 
  dropped off in their activity; however, we have reached an impasse where 
  potential new Contributor pull requests are not getting timely 
  reviews/merges.  We have potential new Contribs. to front-end Runtimes we 
  will look to nominate ASAP, but we still lack back-end Contribs.
   4. The project is still working on establishing an open staging 
  environment to enable proper testing without depending on closed testing 
  infrastructure at involved companies. Unfortunately, even after finally 
  arranging a corporate donation to the ASF in June to support this need, 
  it took until late October for Apache Infra to finish provisioning the 
  machines. 
  5. Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be 
  executed; need to identify process for this. See #3 above.
    * Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list 
    with subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".
    * IBM intends to hand-off ownership of trademarks at time of 
    graduation.
   6. Announcements from Google (Knative) in late July and AWS 
  (Firecracker) just last week apply pressure on our community in order to 
  both explain to developers/operators how OW is differentiated from, as 
  well as compatible with, both popular providers’ frameworks.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  discussion topics/activity being (reflected in comments below as well):

How has the project developed since the last report?

Emphasis on these areas have been featured since last report:

    Google Knative

        Knative and the general popularity of Kubernetes is driving the 
        community to design and document how OW can be compatible with 
        Knative concepts of “Serving”, “Build” and “Eventing”.  Primarily
        we are increasing our friendliness to the Kube community to
        hopefully attract more developers to help us by improving Kube
        deployment docs and configs. for both developers and operators to more
        easily “get started”. Proposals on Wiki have stalled since Sept. need
        to revitalize the conversation.

    Release process

        Initial releases of all “core” repos (both back-end platform and 
        front-end tooling) are complete.  We are adding the release of the 
        new IBM donation of Composer at the time of authoring this report 
        (currently undergoing IPMC VOTE).
        Rename of all "packages" (lib.) names to "apache.org", see: Re: 
        Change the package name into org.apache.openwhisk for openwhisk 
        modules

        We look forward to creating a unified release to assure we have a 
        major/minor version that is tested to be compat. with one another 
        (as now all are disparate releases).
        Need more mentor help at getting release votes through IPMC.

    Website revamp

        Completed.  Now linking in critical developer and operator docs. to 
        be friendlier and provide “how tos” / tutorials to teach OW key 
        features such including Web Actions, Provider samples,  Added
        “getting started” sections for Ruby and Swift, as well as for new
        Docker Desktop (with Kubernetes).

    Runtime updates:

        ActionLoop (part of Go Runtime as of today), supports a general, 
        very fast mechanism for creating new Runtimes (or migrating 
        existing).

        New runtime for the .NET language needs to be taken “over the 
        finish line"
        See initial discussion: dotnet 2.1 Runtime for OpenWhisk

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IP clearance.
  3. First ASF release. (SkyWalking 5.0)
  3. Further ASF culture and processes.
  4. 5.x releases are stable for product, and have 5 open end users, at 
  least.
  5. Support multiple languages agents/SDKs.
  6. Integration with other pupolar OSS systems. Zipkin data format 
  supported.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  5.0.0-RC2, 5.0.0-GA, 6.0.0-alpha

  Started the `Graduate Apache SkyWalking (incubating) as a TLP` discussion 
  in IPMC. IPMC addressed a main issue before graduation, need to promote 
  more committers by given the number of contributors. 
  SkyWalking community has recognised, and voted/passed three new 
  committers, more committers are in discussion and voting process. The 
  PPMCs have learned from the graduation discussion.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. SkyWalking is working with Istio community, in the 6.0.0-alpha 
  release, we support telemetry format from Istio.
  2. Near 50 companies have confirmed they are using SkyWalking 
  through issue report or our powered-by page.
  3. There are 74 people to contribute codes to our main repo. 17 more than 
  the last report.
  4. Three new committors voted and joined. Wenbin Wang, Can Li and Jian 
  Tan. 
  5. A new UI project open source. https://github.com/TinyAllen/rocketbot. 
  It runs as a secondary choice and very cool UI for SkyWalking, by 
  following our query protocol.
  6. baiyang, wangkai, liyuntao, ilucky, zhangkewei, and wangsheng added to

Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase 
  frequency of commits)
  2. Make it easier for Devs to contribute to the project (e.g. 
  documentation, framework).
  3. Developing a workflow in Spot that allows for intuitive analytics.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are currently down to 1 mentor. Although we put a request for an 
  additional mentor, we are not going to push the request until we wrap up 
  what we need to do for the next release. Once we have finished up work 
  and  are ready to set up a vote we will push harder to invite another
  mentor to help us with the process. We anticipate having a lot of
  questions around the release process.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since having pushed through some stagnant pull requests we have noticed a 
  little more activity. We are trying out different ways to make it easier 
  for developers to contribute. We are talking to users to understand what 
  pieces of Spot are important to them.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have identified issues we think would block our release; mainly around 
  the ease of installation and use. We are doing some documentation 
  write-ups and code updates to make the Install process easier. We’re also
  testing out setup on a VM with the aim to make it easier for developers to
  contribute.

Superset

Superset is an enterprise-ready web application for data exploration, data
visualization and dashboarding.

Superset has been incubating since 2017-05-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Project operations - There are 3 specific issues that have been 
  brought to our attention that we are committed to addressing:
  Discussions happening offline from dev@superset.incubator.apache.org 
  (more  below under issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board should be
  aware of)
  Unapproved releases (more below under issues that the Incubator PMC or 
  ASF Board should be aware of)
  Trademark - Some research has been conducted here 
  
https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/PODLINGNAMESEARCH/issues/PODLINGNAME
  SEARCH-124 , but more details have been requested. The expected format 
  output described is not very prescriptive. Just commented asking for a 
  example of a well executed name search. 
  2. Plan and execute our first Apache release.  Though we have been in 
  incubation for a year and a half, we are committed to planning and 
  following through on our first Apache release together with the community 
  by kicking off a discussion thread on dev@superset.incubator.apache.org  
  to align on the deliverables for the first Apache release.
  3. Align on a long-term product roadmap with the broader Apache Superset 
  community.  As a part of planning our first Apache release, we would also 
  like to build out the high-level roadmap for the project with a look 
  ahead of 1 year.  We plan to create this by starting a discussion thread 
  on dev@superset.incubator.apache.org  to work collaboratively on a vision 
  and roadmap for 2019.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware 
of?
  * Discussions happening offline from email - The 
  dev@superset.incubator.apache.org email list has not been very active as 
  a channel of discussion.  To be clear, this is both a result of 1) when
  the list started, GitHub spammed the email list with notifications and 
  our hypothesis is that many people filtered this email alias 2) the Apache 
  email list does not support images making it challenging to support a 
  project that is UI-heavy as a tool for data visualization and 3) other 
  communication channels are being used to compliment the email list.  On 
  #3, there is an open bi-weekly meeting for contributors and committers to 
  discuss issues (no decisions are made here - please see the update on 
  SIPs in the project development section) and while the link to the Google
  Doc with the notes was posted to the dev@superset.incubator.apache.org
  email list, we could have done a better job of posting the notes from the 
  meetings and we recognize that it is more challenging for some community 
  members who live in other timezones to participate.  There are also two 
  reasonably active forums for live discussions (Slack Group 
  http://apache-superset.slack.com and Gitter Channel 
  https://gitter.im/airbnb/superset) however, we now know that casual 
  conversations should only happen on these channels and that the majority 
  of the discussion needs to happen via email.  As a next step, we will
  have an initial meeting with the Mentors, PPMC and Committers on 
Thursday, 
  December 13th to figure out what it takes to address this issue and help
  get the project on track.  We will also use this meeting as an opportunity
  to align across the PPMC and Committers about our obligations and
  responsibilities as well as to receive coaching from our Mentors on the
  Apache Way.
  * Unapproved releases - Currently, committers working on the project have 
  not been following the proper procedures in discussing the content of 
  releases on the dev@superset.incubator.apache.org email list nor have we 
  been consistent in bringing releases to a vote.  This negatively impacts 
  the ability of other community members to participate.  We were uncertain 
  how to manage the LICENSE/COPYRIGHT files and how they relate to 
  convenience releases and we have struggled to understand how to proceed 
  with the name search requirement.  That said, it doesn’t justify pushing 
  a release forward and at a minimum we will discontinue this practice.  We 
  will also discuss this with our Mentors on 12/13 to receive coaching on 
  this topic.
  * As mentioned earlier, having an Apache email list that doesn’t support 
  images makes it very challenging for our project.  We would be interested 
  to know if the ASF Infrastructure Team has any plans to address this.
  * We currently only have 3 active PMCs (1 inactive).  We should strive to 
  add more PMCs to the project.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  * Organic growth of our Github contributors (274->306), forks 
(3627->3974), 
  watchers (1077->1157) and stars (20,519->22,097)
  * Added Krist Wongsuphasawat as a new committer.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  * We have been intentional in discussing and voting on issues using 
  GitHub (for SIPs) as it supports images (a current challenge with the
  Apache email listserv) and held votes for them on the
  dev@superset.incubator.apache.org list
  * Faster, easier editing of datasources (adding new metrics, dimensions, 
  metadata) - We've now added the ability to modify datasources directly 
  from the Explore view. 
  * New time range filter with added simple default options, and relative 
  date filters.
  * Url shortener for dashboards, for easier sharing.
  * Improvements to the visualize flow - You can now go from a sql query 
  right to a chart without needing to configure columns.
  * A healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality improvements and new
  features, take a look at the project’s Pulse on Github for more details

  The project has two mentors showing any level of activity although as
  the project is "about to graduate" it should be almost self-sufficent.
  Graduation is possible though close to the minimum requirements;
  more active PPMC members would be very helpful.

  Due to lack of time I have to resign as mentor.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

## Description:
 The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
 implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
 (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
  stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
  Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
  repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content
  repository. It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class
  web sites and other demanding content applications. In contrast to its
  predecessor, Oak does not implement all optional features from the JSR
  specifications and it is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the unstable development branch are continuously seeing moderate
to high activity.

We are running up to our 5th major release of Oak (1.10). Branching is
expected to happen early January.

A hackathon was held in Bucharest this quarter
(https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/Oakathon%20November%202018) where many
 ideas have been drafted and pondered. Amongst them improvements to our
 release model and better CI coverage for components depending on 3rd party
 services (i.e. cloud providers).

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Oak.

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring the features in for Oak
1.10.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description:
 - Apache Karaf provides a modern and polymorphic applications runtime,
   multi-purpose (microservices, OSGi, etc).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Once Karaf 4.2.2 will be released, master will become Karaf 4.3.x,
   upgrading to OSGi R7.
 - We are working on two new PoC for Karaf:
   * Karaf Vineyard is a API management platform powered by Karaf, providing
     API registry and gateway
   * Karaf Winegrower is the new karaf boot name. The purpose is to provide a
     complete framework/tool allowing developers to start very easily with the
     Karaf ecosystem
 - We also start discussion about improving the Karaf features service to
   better leverage resources repositories.

## Health report:
 - We can see interaction with different community (jclouds, OpenNMS, ...) and
   a general activity increase especially from users community
 - We also agree to define a cadence in Karaf runtime and subprojects release
   cycle (every 3 months). It allows to include fixes/jira update most often
   in release and gives a better roadmap to our users.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 17 PMC members.
 - New PMC members added in the last 3 months: François Papon, Grzegorz
   Grzybek

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Adrien Grand]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We are in the process of releasing Lucene and Solr 7.6.

Lucene 7.6 most notably features better indexing of shapes via a KD tree that
we effectively use as a R-tree. Solr 7.6 is making first steps to discourage
users from using FieldCache to sort or compute facets and contains a number of
incremental improvements to the Stream Evaluator framework.

The release has been a bit frustrating due to the fact that our process
requires that tests pass for the artifacts to be built, yet Solr has a number
of tests that are flaky that forced the release manager to first disable these
tests, and then also attempt to build a new release multiple times until tests
pass. Release management is already challenging on its own so this is
something that needs fixing.

There have been efforts recently to improve stability of tests, but this was
only merged to the master and 7.x branches. So hopefully this issue that we
have had with 7.6 won't occur again when we want to release 7.7.

There are also discussions to release 8.0 in the near future. We wanted to
release 7.6 first but we now expect a branch to be cut any day and master to
move from 8.0 to 9.0.

Uwe Schindler, our "Generics and sophisticated Backwards Compatibility
Policeman", now has access to the OpenJDK bug tracker. We expect it to be
helpful in order to more quickly iterate with JDK developers in the future
when we report bugs.

## PMC changes:

 - No new PMC members
 - Last addition was Cao Mạnh Đạt on on April 2nd 2018

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, A new major feature has being added to 
    Mnemonic code base that this new feature is to support PMDK that is the 
    new SDK that Intel® developed for their Intel® Optane™ technology.
    The Intel® Optane™ technology is a unique combination of Intel® 
    3D XPoint™ memory media with Intel-built advanced system memory
    controller, interface hardware, and software IP. Together, these
    building blocks deliver a game-changing technology that presents new
    computer architecture opportunities and computing possibilities
    for a breadth of markets. 
    The deployment of PMDK requires special configuration for the system, 
    our community are working on that to preparing a stable PMDK runtime
    and development environment with PMDK on varieties of Docker containers.
    The community also considers about the Apache Flink integration with
    Apache Mnemonic.
    We have not yet get much activities and releases in this reporting
    period, probably, the vacation, holidays & shopping seasons, but we have
    a new committer joined our community.
    
Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - Last PMC joined in Jun. 2018

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 14 committers.
 - Last Committer joined in Dec. 2018

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 2018

- Trademarks: since our last report we cleared the backlog of domains needing
  our attention and provided an update to the Trademark team; note that for
  one of the domains (ofbiz.de) the PMC's recommendation to the ASF was to ask
  the current owner to transfer the domain to the foundation (since the owner
  was willing to do so) and we filed a request for this [1]; after our request
  was rejected by the ASF one of our PMC members, Michael Brohl, kindly
  offered to get the ownership of the domain and redirect it to the project's
  official web site
- Vulnerability reports: we are experiencing a remarkable increase in the
  number of security vulnerability reports we receive; although this is great
  because it means that there is interest in the OFBiz product and because
  they are helping us to make OFBiz more solid, processing all these new
  reports is also challenging for our security team; thus, in order to manage
  them efficiently, we are trying to grow the security team and we are
  discussing better ways to organize our work (e.g., using an issue tracker to
  keep better track of the status of each reports, creating templates to help
  us to promptly reply to various emails, etc...)
- Releases: we have published a new release for the 16.11 series; it is a bug
  fix release that also addresses two security vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-8033
  and CVE-2011-3600); since it is the 5th release of the series it is named
  16.11.05; the stabilization of the new release branch, 17.12, is proceeding
  well but we have not scheduled a publication date, yet;
- Various bug fixes and enhancements have been contributed and committed to
  the trunk: a summary  of the main changes is available as usual in the
  project's blog [2]
- More details about the community activities are published in the official
  blog [2], on Twitter [3] and other social media [4].

## Health report:
the committer and PMC base didn't change in the last quarter but we have some
candidates in our watchlist; the community is actively involved in improving
the trunk, fixing vulnerabilities, stabilizing the release branches and in
various discussions and support requests posted mostly in the mailing list and
in Jira

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Koji Noguchi]

## Description:
 - Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets on Hadoop.  It
   provides a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs,
   coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs.


## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We're behind on the next major release of 0.18.

From last board feedback

 > rs: Last PMC member was added more than 2 years ago. This in
 > conjunction with the number of committers being twice as PMC
 > members make me think that perhaps some of these non-PMC
 > committers may be active (and interested enough!) to be coach
 > into PMC membership?
 > 
 > Not having much activity among these non-PMC committers 
 > (if that's the case) would be a useful data point to know in the next report.

Overall activity is comparatively low for the past year as project is mostly
mature and stable.  There are new features and enhancements being worked on,
but the pace is slow as we have fewer people working on Pig who also divide
their time contributing to other Apache projects.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for Dec 2018

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

We are close to releasing SpamAssassin version 3.4.3.

We have added two new PMC members.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 on 16 September 2018.
We are close to releasing version 3.4.3 to address some issues that were
deferred, in part so we could quickly release security fixes in 3.4.2. After
we release 3.4.3 we expect to resume development in our main branch for 4.0.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Noteworthy items:

   increasing and are reportedly more than doubled since last year

## Issues:

 - No issues require board attention.

## Health report:

 - The community is stable as is to be expected from a mature server side Java
   web framework. We don't anticipate a sudden large growth or large decline.

 - Questions to the user list and dev list are answered, resolved and
   discussed.

 - We keep on the look out for new committers and PMC members. The PMC is
   aware that to keep the project healthy new blood is necessary, but are
   realistic that server side Java web frameworks are not the newest and
   hottest technologies at this time.

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]

## Description:

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

There were three big changes in the project over the past quarter.

1) The project has moved to a Maven-based build system.  This change will
enable the project to clean up a lot of automation, additional testing, and
lots of other exciting things.  Before Maven, Yetus was built via a shell
script that lacked much functionality.  Moving to a real build tool has been
on the TODO list for a very long time (YETUS-15!).

2) We've changed contributions to be Lazy Consensus with a 72-hour window.
This change was done primarily to unblock contributions that were having
trouble getting past the patch phase due to lack of review time.  It is hoped
that this will increase project velocity.  The release process is unchanged.

3) We've started publishing convenience artifacts on hub.docker.com.  Combined
with other changes, the Docker images will hopefully increase project adoption
on services such as Circle CI, Travis CI, and GitLab CI in addition to more
traditional Jenkins shops now utilizing Docker.

## Health report:

As predicted, health-wise, this quarter was relatively quiet.  With the above
changes combined with the forced relocation of ASF projects to Gitbox, the
next quarter may prove interesting and/or challenging.

distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.
   
## Issues: 
No issues requiring board attention.
   
## Activity: 
 - No new releases during the reporting period.
 - Facebook hosted a ZooKeeper meetup on Nov. 08.
   (https://www.facebook.com/zkmeetup)
 - We had one issue reported to the security list, which is under
   discussion.
  
## Health report: 
 - We added one new committer during the reporting period and we are
always on the look for new contributors who are interested in stepping
their community participation up. 
 - We had a significant growth in the dev list activity: 62% increase
compared to the previous quarter. 
   
## PMC changes:
