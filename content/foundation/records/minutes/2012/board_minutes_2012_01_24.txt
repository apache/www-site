 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       No report was submitted.

    B. President [Jim]

       Thanks to our EA, the foundation calendar is a reality. If you need
       access, just contact myself or Melissa.

       Thanks also to Joe and Sam for cleaning up the main ASF page; when
       pulling in content from the blog and/or mailing lists, some invalid
       characters would leak out causing the site to look really, really bad.
       Filtering was added to the CMS system to address this.

       I will be starting the formal budgeting process this month.

       The mailing lists have been relatively quiet; the foundation is
       running on greased grooves.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

       No report was submitted.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

      The office of secretary@ continues to run smoothly with help from official
      and unofficial volunteers.

      In December, 60 ICLAs and five CCLAs were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       No report was submitted.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       Nothing to report. There was an intent for me to run the
       January meeting, but the date was moved to allow Doug to Chair
       the meeting.

    Executive officer reports approved as submitted by General Consent.

 8. Discussion Items
    
    A. Apache Open Office Extensions site and SourceForge offer
       Discuss this (from Ross Gardler on board@) unless already done.
    
       The aoo pmc wants to arrange for hosting of ooo extensions now on
       the oo.o site.

       Extensions include templates and dictionaries, which are not
       necessarily licensed to Apache.

       Infra is willing to host a metadata site but not a download site,
       due to bandwidth issues.

       Sourceforge has volunteered to host a site, giving root access to
       authorized ppmc folks.

       Downloads from sourceforge have advertising, which pays for running
       the service.

       Apache.org domains should not have advertising on them.

       Advice from board: proceed with sourceforge; can host extensions on
       sourceforge.org domain; ok for non-apache download site to have
       advertising; continue to work on a long term solution.

    B. Termination of VP, JCP

       AI Jim: discuss with Geir, prepare a resolution for termination for
       February 2012.

    C. How is the calendar supposed to work?  There is a Feb 9th item in
       the calendar.  Is the EA tasked with sending out reminders?

       Jim and Melissa are working to add items to the calendar. The plan 
       was for Melissa to manage the items on the calendar, not to remind
       folks. But Melissa can set up reminders on request.
 
       Should the calendar be publicly available? Not now, as there are
       private items included. If we want the calendar to be public, we
       will need to have a separate calendar. But the calendar is intended
       for the use of the board so it's not clear why the calendar should
       be public, except that's what Apache usually does.
 
       Access to the calendar is by secret url, that can be changed at
       will. Security by obscurity. Any member should be able to get the
       secret url on request to Melissa. 

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Philip: follow up on /dist with Perl PMC
            Status: Action Item transferred to Sam

            Status: Shane to follow up with the ActiveMQ PMC.

                    Mail lists still need to be removed.

    * Jim: Assist C++ Standard Library in move to the attic
            Status: They agree attic makes sense. Reso will be provided
                    for next month.

    * Jim: prepare a resolution to create a VP of OSI.
            Status: Awaiting formal affiliate agreement from OSI.

    * Geir Magnusson Jr: prepare to discuss termination of VP, JCP at next
      board meeting
            Status: Jim now has an action item to get with Geir

    * Jim: discuss calendar improvements suggested by Shane with Melissa
            Status: covered in the Discussion Items

    * Sam and Shane: discuss invoicing of sponsors with Serge.
            Status: no more follow up needed

    * Sam: follow up with Zookeeper PMC re: adoption of Curator project
            Status: no update

    * Bertrand: discuss with Sally how to get her invoices submitted in
      the appropriate place in svn.
            Status: Done - Sally will send future invoices to board@ and
                    ask for someone to commit them to svn.
                    If there's a regular schedule for paying invoices,
                    she'd like to be informed so that she can get them in
                    at the appropriate time.

Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
Our announcement about the OSCON CFP was thwarted by the message not being
moderated through in time. (Everyone on concom@ got the cc'd copy, which is
one of the reasons why we didn't notice the problem in time...) This is a
shame, but we think at least some Apache talks were submitted anyway.

We have received a few third party event requests, all of which have seemed
fine in theory, but all of which are awaiting a few more bits of information
before approval can be granted.

Small Events
------------
The planned Knocktree Retreat won't be going ahead, as there weren't enough
people interested in attending on any of the weekends the venue is
available.

There was a feeling that a Retreat style event should be tried during the
week, but the venue used in the past isn't able to support this. No suitable
alternate venues have been found, and there doesn't seem that much volunteer
energy to drive it (largely due to the failure to attract people for the
planned weekend one)

On a more positive note, a DC event is in the planning.

ApacheCon
---------
We're still waiting to hear back from SAP on which week in late 2012 we can
have, and linked to that which exact conference centre + space we've got.
(This is the process of turning our outline approval into a specific space
on a specific date). Christmas seems to have got in the way of the approval
process.

A few areas of the RFP have generated lots of discussion, but we think we've
now finished. We're hoping to open the RFP this week, once the new list to
capture submissions is open and people are subscribed

*Update 23rd Jan* The RFP has now opened

Committee
---------
No new committee members have been added this month, and there are not
currently any in the pipeline.

Planning for the future of the committee has taken a backseat to the RFP,
but with any luck should be tackled this coming month

Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Still attempting to pursue a github FI instance for ASF use.

Intervision LOC has still not been filled out and sent off.

We've determined there is adequate space (9U free) for us
to install our new gear in SARA.  However we are in need
of an additional switch, which is tasked to Uli Stärk for
purchase.

Awaiting a final decision from the OpenOffice podling regarding
hosting of extensions and templates.  They are considering
either hosting those services locally at the ASF or with
SourceForge.

Joe spent a few hours training Melissa (EA) on svn use.
A google calendar is now available for everyone's use
thanks to Melissa.

Secured and rolled out a wildcard cert from Thawte.

Dealt with a minor security issue in the Nexus installation,
reported by Sebastian Bazley.

Partitioned our SSL termination for our linux hosts to separate
VM's for additional security.

Began deploying puppet for eventual management of our linux hosts.

Dealt with a benign security incident on modules.apache.org.

Further enhanced CMS performance with the introduction of parallel
builds.

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and 
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, 
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports 
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.


Releases:
2.3.8 released
2.4.4 released
2.4.5 released
2.5.0 released
2.5.1 released

Committer added:
Oliver Wulff


Community updates:
The 2.5.0 release was done in late October (and subsequent 2.5.1 patch release 
in December) which was a big milestone for CXF as it provided a bunch of new 
features and enhancements.  The response has been very good with several 
requests on the lists and JIRA's filed and such.  Some work has been started 
to update the DOSGi subproject to the latest 2.5.1 release as well as 
introduce some new features and enhancements there.  A release of that should 
be done soon.

Some work has been started on trunk to cleanup the code a bit (compile 
warnings removed), enhance the OSGi support, etc...  Early discussions on 
ideas for 2.6.0 have started with the work targeting that.

13 committers committed changes during the period. A total of 987 commits 
were done, with 519 of them on trunk.  (the rest were back porting fixes to 
branches as well as some work in the sandbox).  From a diversity standpoint, 
6 committers from one company were responsible for roughly 80% of the commits,
4 committers from a second at 7% and the remaining 13% among the other 3 
independents.  Those numbers are slightly concerning but not unexpected.
It should be noted, however, that the release manager for one of the releases 
(2.4.4) was an employee from the second and was the first release in a long 
time not managed by me (dkulp) which is a very welcome change.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:

Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes
that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system
administrators.

The community released our first Java EE 6 compliant
server (Geronimo 3.0-beta-1). 3.0-beta-1 is both web profile and
full profile compliant. There were additional releases of additional
components and server versions. 

RELEASES 

The community released 3.0-beta-1 versions of our
server, samples, and eclipse plugin. Geronimo 2.1.8 was also
released.

CONFERENCES

Two Geronimo presentations were given at ApacheCon in Vancouver.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
computers.

On the people side, we have new person join our ranks.
  * We've added one new committer - Siddharth Seth.

On the project side, we have made some very exciting progress. We have
had a total of 3 releases:
 - hadoop-0.23.0 released from trunk, first one off trunk in nearly 2 years.
 - hadoop-0.22.0 released, branched in early 2011. 
 - hadoop-1.0.0 released of branch-0.20.2xx baseline (now branch-1) 
 - https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces21

 - Work on further Hadoop 0.23.1 release is continuing, and is
   scheduled for release at the end of the month

 - Developer community is working well together. The public dialogue
   among vendors who employ many in the developer community seems to
   have died down since the last board report. No action from the
   board is required at this stage.

 - Some vendors are continuing to use the lists to promote their own
   products. A few PMC members have responded to discourage this
   practice, but not directly as the PMC. No action from the board is
   required at this stage.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

A number of substantive issues came up during the past month.

First, and although it was raised on the private list and therefore details
won't be part of the public report, we advise the Board that there is
substantial discussion regarding changing the Incubator VP, which has been
held for almost 8 years by the current VP.

Second, there is a dispute, both in the abstract and concretely, regarding
whether or not the ASF, via the Incubator, may play host to a community that
has forked a compatibly licensed codebase.  Roy suggested that, in the
specific case:

> The VOTE was based on misleading information.  The Incubator PMC should declare it
> void and request a new proposal.  The existing Bloodhound podling should be
> placed on hold until this is sorted out.

Greg has said, more recently, that "the Bloodhound and Trac communities
already have a new non-fork plan and are executing on that now, on the
bloodhound-dev mailing list."  If that comes to pass, perhaps no further
attention from the PMC and Board will be required on this issue.  If not,
we'll have to revisit the specific case.

However, Bill Rowe has requested that the Incubator PMC formally put the
general matter to the Board: what policy do or should we have regarding a
community that wishes to fork a suitably licensed codebase and come to the
ASF?  If so, what is that policy?  Or is that decision still a matter to be
determined situationally by the Incubator PMC?  For whatever it is worth,
the latter is the opinion of the Incubator VP, who recalls that more than
one successful ASF project started elsewhere and came to the ASF as a fork,
and not without some complaint from members of the outside community (e.g.,
Apache Felix).

Third, there was a lot of discussion surrounding a couple of Incubator
issues: 1) podlings being comfortably settled in the Incubator, and not
being focused enough on graduation; 2) Mentors being insufficiently active,
and thus not providing either proper guidance or oversight.  We definitely
need to address these issues, promoting both Mentor involvement and
graduation from the Incubator.  And, finally, Jukka spent time reviewing the
status of many of the older podlings, and recommending an action.

Perhaps not coincidentally, ACE, Gora and Bean Validation Framework are all
in graduation mode.  But, meanwhile, Bloodhound (the podling previously
mentioned), DeviceMap and Flex have joined.

Below are podling reports.  Sam Ruby has already reviewed the original list
prior to posting, and requested that specific posts not be provided to the
Board, as he was unhappy with their status:

   Kato: has been in limbo for years due to Oracle.  The podling needs
     to decide what to do, or terminate
   Bloodhound, HISE, JSPWiki and Openmeetings: missing
   VXQuery: not signed off by a Mentor

Although initially requested to be excluded, the Celix and Tashi reports
were revised to provide at least some graduation guidance, and so their
reports are included, below.

---------------------------------------------------------

Any23

Any23 is defined as a Java library, a Web service and a set of command line
tools to extract and validate structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents and markup formats. Any23 is what it is informally named an
RDF Distiller.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Port Any23 code to ASF infrastructure and update license headers
  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
     strong connections to other relevant ASF communities.
  3. At least one Any23 incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

Yes, all of the code has been ported from Google Code to the ASF. Thanks to
Daniel Shahaf and Michele Mostarda for leading the charge here.

How has the community developed since the last report?

All ASF karma has been granted on the repository, and we've received a few
JIRA issues, but not from outside the core set of PPMC members as of yet. The
team needs to respond to Paolo Castagna's points regarding RDF frameworks and
collaboration, and will hopefully do so this month.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.

We have Jenkins CI builds going thanks to Lewis John McGibbney, code up and
running at the ASF thanks to Michele and to Daniel, so we're all set to really
get kicking!

--------------------
Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

Over the last few months lots of work has been put into integrating APR and
updating the Celix code base to the proposed code style. This code style has
partially been documented on [1]. Also some effort has been put into
updating the source for Visual Studio, even though not yet finished some
interesting and helpful patches were submitted and applied.

In October an event was held to create more awareness for services, OSGi and
Celix in the Dutch embedded community. The attendance was great, and a
follow-up will be planned. Also, in November a talk was given at the
ApacheCon.

As listed below, one of the most important issues is the slow growth of the
Celix community. With the current discussion about podlings and how long a
podling is in the incubator, we are discussing a plan how we can move to a
more diverse community and be able to graduate. This plan will be included
in the next board report.

Most important issues are:

* Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc), resulting in a first release
* Generate awareness and grow a community!


--------------------

Chukwa

Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop's
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best
use of the collected data.

* Updated LICENSE and NOTICE files to comply with IPMC requests
* Updated Hadoop dependency to Hadoop 1.0.0
* Vote in progress for Chukwa 0.5.0 Release Candidate 3

When Chukwa 0.5.0 is officially released, Chukwa will complete all required
goals to graduate incubation.


--------------------

Cordova

December was a busy month. Lots of updates to the code base and our working
toolchain.

We would particularly like to thank infra for all the work getting us setup
with git. We really appreciate the effort and valuable discussion
surrounding it. It is this sort of attention to community that makes us
grateful to be members of the Apache community.

* shipped 1.3 with full windows phone support (NOTE: this was not an ASF
release; this is next for us)
* BlackBerry Playbook support
* started migration to Cordova name
* git migration complete
* battery events api
(http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.3.0/phonegap_events_events.md.html#Events)
* first version of the project web site up

Graduation concerns:

* Complete the migration to Apache infrastructure
* Make an official Apache release
* Grant committership to new contributors


--------------------

Deft

Deft is a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven high performance web
framework running on the JVM. The project entered incubation on 2011-07-08.

The most important issues to address in moving to graduation:

  1. Prepare an initial incubation release.
  2. Attract more committers, and other community members.
  3. Secure the previously used URL, "deftserver.org".

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?
- Not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?
- There have been no significant developments.

How has the project developed since the last report?
- Outstanding tasks are still being worked on.


--------------------

DeltaSpike

(incubating since December 2011)

DeltaSpike will consist of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide
useful features for Java application developers. The goal of DeltaSpike is
to create a de-facto standard of CDI-Extensions that is developed and
maintained by the community.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

Since our last report on December 12, 2011, we have accomplished the
following:

 - Finished the discussion about coding conventions and added the
corresponding checkstyle rules
 - Finished the discussion on the first features
 - Finished infrastructure topics together with the infrastructure team (GIT
   repository, nightly builds with Jenkins, Sonar setup)
   (Only the JIRA plug-in for GIT is missing because there are issues with
   using it side by side with the plug-in for SVN)
 - Most initial committers signed their ICLA and got their account
 - Started discussions on the next features
 - Started with the build structure
 - Started with the test-infrastructure
 - Started to migrate core feature contributions from Seam3 and CODI
 - Started to add information to the Wiki to help new folks getting involved
 - Started discussions about tools for our documentation and website
 - Started with the status page (based on
   http://incubator.apache.org/guides/website.html)

Upcoming major goals:

 - Finish test-infrastructure to allow in-container tests
 - Finish the setup for the documentation and the website
 - Finish the discussions for all features which will be part of the first
release

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

1. Build community
2. Create at least one release
3. Create Documentation


--------------------

DirectMemory

(incubating since October 2011)

Apache DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring
off-heap memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient handling of
a large number of java objects without affecting jvm garbage collection
performance.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.

1) closed - Branding requirements have been met and modified logos and
   artwork have been published
2) Understanding process/decision making guidelines (new committer process
   is undergoing testing, release process still yet to be worked out)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of

- None - we are going well even having lost one mentor (but always hope
he'll keep in touch ;)

How has the community developed since the last report

- Tasks and proposals contributed by non-committers
- The team is voting a new committer

How has the project developed since the last report.
- Some examples are being added to the code base including another
interesting integration with Apache Solr


--------------------

EasyAnt

Easyant is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy. Incubating
since 2011-01-31.

Towards graduation, we need to:
* Create a release
* Build a community

Since the last report:
* no particular progress on the diversity of the community
* very little activity on the developer mailing list


--------------------

Empire-db

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and
DBMS independence. Empire-db has entered Incubation in August 2008.

Activity since last report:
* Last month we voted for graduation, submitted our resolution which was
revoked because of a copy-paste issue
* A fixed resolution will be submitted for this month's board meeting


--------------------

Flex

Flex is an application framework for building Flash-based applications.

Entered incubation December 30th, 2011.

The podling is just getting started, accounts and infrastructure are being
created.


--------------------

Giraph

Giraph is a large-scale, fault-tolerant, Bulk Synchronous Parallel
(BSP)-based graph processing framework that runs on Hadoop. Giraph
entered the incubator in August 2011.

Project developments:

* Sebastian Schelter, and Claudio Martella were added to the PPMC
* Review Board in frequent use and high traffic on dev and commit lists
* ICLA on file from all committers

Next steps:
* Adding new committers.
* Making a release.


--------------------

Kafka

(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011)

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Invite diverse new active committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

We incurred significant overhead during our first release; see
http://apache.markmail.org/message/rsxjgrrufc6khlqy?q=list:org%2Eapache%2Eincubator%2Egeneral+from:%22junrao%22
for reference. Firstly, there is no good example to follow for a new podling.
Secondly, the licensing rules are complex and the documentation is not enough
for a new podling to understand.  This gets more complicated since different
IPMC members have different views and apply those rules slightly differently.
This delays releases and causes overhead to the team. We hope that some of
these things can be addressed to make the process easier to other projects.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Activities in the mailing list increased 4x since the last report. Several
patches from non-committers have been submitted, reviewed and committed.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have successfully completed the first release of Kafka after joining the
incubator. This releases adds the end-to-end compression feature and
mirroring support in Kafka. In addition to this, it also fixes more than 40
issues.


--------------------

Kitty

Incubating since 2010-10-03

Description
 Kitty is a command line JMX Client written in Groovy.
 It is a lightweight, production focused, application server performance
 diagnostic and management utility.

The three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
 1) The community around this project is absent, looking at the amount of
    mails sent to the mailing list in the past months
 2) The lack of a "Product Owner" who can prioritise stories/tasks, leaving
    the developers without a clue about the functionalities to implement
 3) The code is a port from another language (Jython), and the history of
    the past project seems lost, so there isn't any reference about how the
    actual code should work. Also, there is no test (acceptance criteria) in
    support of that nor for the new features to implement.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of?

 What seems relevant to me at the moment is the lack of communication between
 the committers; it would be fine if there was a clear statement about who is
 still interested and who is not in participating in the project, and how to
 reorganise the now shrunken team, if still there is one.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Sadly, the community hasn't develop at all; even worse, we faced the loss of
 some members who were actively involved in the project
 development/management.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Jira is not updated, leaving a shade of uncertainty about what has been fixed
 and what is still in progress since the last report.  It seems that the last
 update was done in October, the 4th, with a fix regarding the correct
 navigation through the server tree in a file-system fashion.


--------------------

Lucy

Lucy is a loose port of the Apache Lucene search engine library, written in C
and targeted at dynamic language users.

Lucy was voted into the Incubator on July 22, 2010.

Progress since the last report:

 * Added new Committers/PPMC-members Nick Wellnhofer and Logan Bell.

Top priorities prior to graduation:

 * None.  We will likely be discussing graduation as soon as version 0.3.0
  is released.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * None at this time.


--------------------

Mesos

Mesos is a scalable cluster manager that can dynamically share resources
between multiple computing frameworks, including Hadoop, Spark and MPI.

Mesos entered incubation on December 23, 2010.

Progress since the last report:

* Shooting for an end of January release. Hope to call a release vote by
  early next week.

  have contributed to Mesos.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * None at this time.


--------------------

ODFToolkit

The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of
heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is
lightweight and ideal for server use.

* ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011.

* Most important issues to address.
 1) Successful podling release.
 2) Growing the community, increasing diversity of committers


* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
 None at this time.

* How has the community developed since the last report
 We have a new committer: Oliver Rau.

* How has the project developed since the last report.
 1) With the help of mentor, Jenkins support for the build is ready.
 2) We are voting for the candidate (RC7) of the first release.


--------------------

Oozie

Oozie is a workflow management and scheduler primarily for Hadoop based
jobs.

Oozie entered the incubation on July 11, 2011.

* A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
  * Make the first Oozie release from Apache incubation.
  * Further improve the documentations: user, development for quicker adoption
  * Establish the formal release process.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:
   * No issues.

* How has the community developed since the last report:
  * Oozie dev/users are active in the email lists (1152 Email in oozie-dev
    and in oozie-user 212).
  * Around 7 new developers are contributing to the process and coding.
  * 84 JIRAs were created since last report.

* How has the project developed since the last report.
      * A lot of new features are added. Fixed a lot of bugs too. Nearly 85
        JIRAs were closed/resolved in last three months.
      * Oozie product web page is improved and more usable.  Further
        improvement is ongoing on.
      * The process has started for cutting the first release from Apache.


--------------------

Tashi

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud computing
on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data). The idea is to
build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that are stored in
a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by
remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi originally encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and QEMU, but has been merged with Zoni, which manages the
physical aspects of a cluster like power control, network settings and
handing out physical machines.

Development activities have included:-
       * Accounting server has been added to the codebase
       * Primitive scheduler changes
               * bug fixes
               * Add support for user choice of dense packing or not
               * Guard against starting more than one VM with
                 persistent disk
       * Client changes
               * Check syntax of user commands
               * Add support for querying available images
               * Add support for querying image size
               * Add support for copying of images
       * QEMU VMM changes
               * bug fixes
               * Reserve some memory for the host itself
               * Make scratch location configurable
               * Live migrations take a long time, eliminate
                 some timeout values
       * Cluster manager changes
               * bug fixes
               * Reduce network traffic
               * Move accounting functions to new accounting server
       * Branched off new stable version and release candidate
       * Audit compliance with Incubator policies

The project is still working toward building a larger user and development
community. User groups have been identified in Ireland, Slovenia and Korea,
Malaysia, as well as the United States.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
       * A stable branch exists which could be a release candidate, but
         the codebase is large and test hardware is currently in
         short supply. We are confident that the code in the stablefix
         branch will work if running QEMU emulation, Pickle or sqlite
         data storage, primitive scheduler. Xen, other data stores and
         schedulers have not been tested recently.
       * Develop community diversity (Committers currently at Telefonica,
         Google and CMU)

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache JMeter Project

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a Java application designed to load
test functional behavior and measure performance.

This is the third monthly board report for the JMeter TLP.

Work continues on fixing bugs and implementing new features and
generally tidying up the code.

There have been no changes to the PMC or committers since the last report.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

As previously reported, it is believed that all the branding
requirements have been completed.

There are no board level issues at this time.

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Mahout Project

Apache Mahout provides implementations of machine learning algorithms 
(collaborative filtering, clustering, classification, and more) for 
large-scale data, mostly via Hadoop-based implementations.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Activity has been high during the past 3 months as we have begun
the release process for 0.6. Of 181 issues targeted for this release,
there are only 4 remaining.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

Maven Board Report - Jan 2012
---------------------------

* General Information

  * Vote to use aether 1.13 and sisu 2.3.0 as dependencies of Apache Maven
  
  * Progress on the Memorandum of Understanding with Sonatype continues, though
    it has been slowed by the availability of John Casey and others to continue
    hammering out the language. It seems that we're down to the point where 
    we're fine-tuning legal definitions and such in the MOU as it's written. 
    
    John hopes this effort will be completed in the next month, though it 
    depends on the extent to which we need to renegotiate the terms with 
    Sonatype after we're done pinning down the legal ramifications.

Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache Nutch is an open source web-search software project. Stemming from
Apache Lucene, it now builds on Apache Solr adding web-specifics, such as a
crawler, a link-graph database and parsing support handled by Apache Tika for
HTML and an array of other document formats.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Nutch 1.4 has been released on 26th November 2011. A number of issues has been
filled in JIRA for 1.5. The GORA-based branch (2.0) is benefiting from the
progress made in GORA but a release is not yet planned. Recent patches have
upgraded some of our dependencies on other Apache projects such as Tika,
Hadoop or Gora.

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high level
in the last quarter. Some of the committers met at ApacheCon NA 2011 in
November and discussed Nutch and its interaction with GORA. Finally the book
Tika in Action (one of the co-authors Chris Mattmann is a Nutch committer and
PMC member) contains quite a few references to Nutch, which should contribute
to exposing the project to a wider audience.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services,
sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error
recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that
are part of your application.

Status
======

This was again a quiet development period. We are still in the situation
that the development speed has decreased and the project lacks of dev
resources. We still have some development items on our agenda, e.g.
OModel refactoring, and are thinking of adding a BPMN 2.0
implementation, which may bring ODE back to life since all available
open source BPMN 2.0 implementations lack the Web services messaging
support that is needed for serious SOA scenarios and that is in the core
of ODE already.

Release
=======

No release to report in this quarter.

Development
===========

No significant progress to report.

Community
=========

Nothing to report.

Project Branding Board Report Checklist
=======================================

It turned out to be difficult for us to change the template of our web
site. We use the autoexport plugin for Confluence and we have been told
that Confluence admin permissions are needed in order to edit the
templates. These permissions, however, are not granted anymore. As a
"workaround" we plan to migrate to the new CMS and will address the
branding issues then as well.

 - Project Website Basics : homepage is project.apache.org ✔
 - Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc. ✔
 - Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
   www.apache.org included ✘
 - Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
   footers, etc. ✘
 - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
   site ✘
 - Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date ✔

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

Apache OpenEJB is an enterprise application containers and object distribution
services based on, the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Web Profile.

Primary activity over the last quarter has been on keeping up with bug fixes
and generally supporting the OpenEJB 4.0.0-beta-1 and TomEE 1.0.0-beta-1
release shipped in early.

The project switched to the Apache CMS just prior to ApacheCon and developed a
new website heavily featuring TomEE.  The site itself is still under
development and work is still in progress on how to best communicate TomEE and
OpenEJB together.  The change to the CMS has been incredibly positive and very
productive and confluence is no longer in use.

Heavy development has been done in the area of OSGi support and integration
with Apache Karaf.  The effort has been an overlapping with contributions
coming from both communities.

Contributor, Vishwanath Krishnamurthi, was voted in as a committer and is also
a new face at Apache.  He's contributed some great things to the
infrastructure (twitter bot), documentation and examples.  We're very excited
to have him in the community and to welcome him into Apache.

Work on the OpenEJB 4.0.0-beta-2 and TomEE 1.0.0-beta-2 release has been
ongoing for the last two weeks.  A second set of binaries are up for a vote
currently.  Releasing frequently has been a challenge for the project and in
efforts to improve that a considerable amount of work has been done to create
tooling for automating the release tasks.  Hopefully this will bring us closer
to the goal of releasing frequently which has been discussed and agreed upon
several times, but the weight of the code has thus far kept it from being a
reality.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

* Highlights

  Apache OpenJPA provides POJO persistence for stand-alone JSE, JEE
  container and many other lightweight frameworks, such as Tomcat,
  Spring or OSGi.

* Community

  Mailing lists continue to be very active and many instances of developers
  migrating from other vendors to OpenJPA can be cited.

  The developer community had maintained steady rate of defect resolution
  and support for previous releases.

* Governance

   We continue to monitor contributors for possible committers and
   PMC members.

* Releases

  Discussion started for OpenJPA 2.2.0 release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache PDFBox Project

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF
documents.


General Comments
----------------

There are no issues that require Board attention.

Community
---------

There is a steady stream of contributions and bug reports from the
community.

Releases
--------

No release this quarter.

Development:
------------

The development on the next release is still in progress. We are currently
working on

- a new conforming parser
- improved font handling
- improved rendering
- refactoring + improved integration of preflight

Maybe our next release will be a major release, but it's still to early
to go for it as the discussion about it just started some time ago. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Shindig Project

Apache Shindig is an Opensocial Reference implementation in wide use by
both social networks and enterprise software.  Shindig graduated from the
Incubator in January 2010.

The Shindig PMC has no issues that require board attention.


COMMUNITY

The project continues to enjoy broad contributions with an active
community and mailing list.  The Apache Rave project is using
Apache Shindig and has provided patches and assistance.

We voted in four new committers and PMC members this quarter.  Six
members requested emeritus status after the chair asked inactive
members about their status.


RELEASES

* 3.0.0-beta3 released October, 2011
* 3.0.0-beta4 released November, 2011

Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.1 - various bug fixes and improvements such as plugin support for
  Contexts And Dependency Injection (CDI) and Portlet 2.0
* Struts 2.3.1.1 - security fix release

In December we announced the end of life for the Struts 2.0.x branch, which
for some time was supported in parallel to the Struts 2 trunk releases, due to
breaking API changes introduced with Struts 2.1. However, important security
fixes did not make it into the Struts 2.0.x branch lately. For that reason we
recommended our users to switch all their existing applications to the latest
Struts 2 versions.

With the latest releases we closed two important security issues reported by
JPCERT [1] and Sec Consult [2]. Dealing with both issues and their reporters
went very well both in terms of communication and disclosure as well as time
to fix.

In the last quarter we added Maurizio Cucchiara (mcucchiara) and John Lindal
(jafl) to the PMC. Christian Grobmeier (grobmeier) was added as a new
committer in this period.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Trademarks and Project Branding (ongoing)
----------------------------------------
Trademark Attributions: ongoing

Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a component-based Java web framework that combines high
performance, extensibility, conciseness, and excellent developer productivity.

It has been a busy quarter for Tapestry; we've released Tapestry 5.3, a
significant upgrade to Tapestry functionality and performance, just under a
year after the 5.2 release. We have followed up with a 5.3.1 bug fix release,
with at least one more bug fix release planned.

The Tapestry 5.3.1 vote and release was executed by Massimo Lusetti which is
notable as nearly all other recent releases where executed by Howard Lewis
Ship.

Some initial work on Tapestry 5.4 is already underway.

Mailing list activity remains steady, with approximately 1400-1500
messages/month on the mailing lists.

Widely used third party libraries (developed outside of Apache) such as

Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Thrift Project

Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Community
No new committers since the last report, but we've seen a steady flow of new 
contributors sending in patches. The software seems to be improving at a fair 
clip.

Releases
We released Thrift 0.8 and are accumulating issues into Thrift 0.9.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

What is Tika?  
========================= 
Apache Tika is a dynamic
toolkit for content detection, analysis, and extraction. It allows
a user to understand, and leverage information from, a growing a
list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code,
and science data) as recognized by IANA and other standards bodies.

Releases 
========================= 
We released Tika 1.0 on 11/7/11
[1] to coincide with Apache Con NA 2011. Since then we've been
working on the 1.1 release, with 42 issues already resolved in JIRA
[2] and 1.1 likely to be shipped in the next quarter.

Community 
========================= 
We added Jerome Charron and
Antoni Mylkato the Tika PMC in November 2011.

At ApacheCon NA, and since, there have been some discussions regarding
Tika and the ODF Toolkit [3], as well as the Tika PMC's sponsorship
of the Any23 incubator project [4], which is progressing along.

Mailing list activity on dev@ remained steady in November and
December 2011 (259, 287 messages) but slowed in January 2012 (21
messages, respectively), while the user activity remained consistent
in November and December 2011 (47 and 65 messages), but has been
quiet in January 2012 (12 messages).

Chris Mattmann gave a talk at ApacheCon NA 2011 on "Apache Tika:
One Point Oh!" [5] commemorating the upcoming 1.0 Tika release.
Chris also had some discussions about Any23 and Tika with Lewis
John McGibbney at ApacheCon NA 2012. Lewis is a Nutch PMC member,
the candidate for the Gora VP with the current board resolution and
an Any23 Incubator committer.

Press
========================= 
Chris and Jukka and Sally have
published a press release [6] about Tika's use at NASA, as well as
its use at Day Software and other companies. The press release went
out during ApacheCon NA 2011 and was perfect timing with the event.

Tika In Action 
========================== 
Chris Mattmann and Jukka
Zitting completed the Manning book called "Tika in Action" [7] in
time for ApacheCon NA 2011. The book is now available in print,
ebook and mobi editions. Yay!

Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

No new committers were added since the last report, but several new
contributors have appeared, submitting excellent bug reports and
patches. The hope is that some of these contributors will become
committers in the future. The mailing lists are seeing our normal growth,
the current tallies are:

    users@   - 243 subscribers (up 15% since last report)
    dev@     - 175 subscribers (up 11% since last report)

Three presentations related to Apache Traffic Server were given in the
last quarter: two at ApacheCon 2011 (Vancouver), and one at Usenix LISA
(Boston). We're planning a Feathercast session in the near future.


Releases
========

Two releases have been made since the last status report:

    3.0.2 - The second stable release update on the 3.0 branch
    3.1.1 - Additional trunk development towards v3.2.

Primary focus right now includes

    * Stability and bug fixes, without performance regressions
    * Full IPv6
    * Improvements related to SSL and addition of features such as SNI and
      NPN, and public APIs related to such features.
    * Continued improvements and additions to the plugin APIs.


The v3.2 release is delayed, probably close to 3 months later than we had
initially expected (and hoped for). v3.1.2 is almost ready for release,
and will be followed by at least a v3.1.3 and most likely a v3.1.4
release. The new goal is for a v3.2 release sometime in Q1 of 2012.

Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

             Web Services Report for January 2012

Releases
--------
* WSS4J 1.6.4

General
-------

* A light quarter for WS activity.  JIRAs still getting filed and
  fixed, not a lot of new development.

* Although much of our branding + restructuring work has been
  completed, there is still more to do and it's been challenging to
  get cycles from the PMC for this kind of work.  Benson Margulies
  kicked off a thread on the PMC list about this, and it seems to be
  having the desired effect of turning up the heat under the team.
  There is a concrete proposal on the table to rework and modernize
  the website.
