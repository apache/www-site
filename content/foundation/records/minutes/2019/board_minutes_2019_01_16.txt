 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       Progress continued slowly last month on updating the 5-year plan. I am
       hoping we can get drafts for all sections and the updated financials
       to review next month.

       I have also started planning for the 2019 Members meeting, which will
       coincide with our 20th anniversary.

       The Treasurer's report indicates that the ASF is in very good shape
       financially, 8 months into this fiscal year.  We are approximately
       $400k ahead on revenue and $300k under in expense.  Some of this is
       timing, but we are on track to grow our reserve significantly this
       year.  I plan to spend some time this month working with Tom (as VP,
       Finance) on options for reserve management (e.g. endowment).

    B. President [Sam]

       Issues for the board:

        * FY24 projections are posted as a discussion item.  At this point,
          the perfect is the enemy of the good, and I feel that we have
          enough data to make a decision.  More later in this report.
        * Last month, Rich asked for a Fundraising plan to be posted
          (possibly privately) by the previous board meeting.  At the time, I
          said the timing wouldn't work out, and ultimately the plan was
          posted shortly after the meeting.  Details are included in the
          fundraising report (some of them are indeed marked as private), and
          a link to the December discussion is present in the report.  I
          believe that this satisfies the request.
        * Finance continues to be quiet.  Unless I hear otherwise, I am going
          to assume that the board is OK with this.  If anybody is concerned
          about something not happening on a schedule, please speak up.

       Details:

       Brand Management and Finance continue to operate smoothly. 
       Fundraising continue to be ahead of plan in terms of revenue, and has
       posted a new long range approach to how work will be divided between
       volunteers and paid staff.

       I typically summarize the treasurer's report, but this time I will
       lift a direct quote: "At this point in the FY we are doing very well,
       ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking timing
       variances into account."

       This brings us to the FY24 outlook.  It shows a plan which includes a
       modest surplus.  I am going to say that that presents a significant
       problem - in a good way.  Given a track record of under-running
       expenses and producing more income than projected (as an example, the
       projection for the operating cash at the end of the fiscal year
       increased by $80K since last month), coupled with a healthy reserve,
       these numbers should be treated as highly conservative.

       In prior discussions, it was observed that (and I'm paraphrasing
       here): we don't solicit money for the purpose of sitting on it.  This
       implies that now would be a good time to brainstorm on ideas for
       additional things that we should be investing in.  This could be
       large, one time, expenses.  Or smaller, ongoing expenses.  I suggest
       that the board come up with (or collect and cull) ideas, and I'll see
       to it that operations help size the costs for these ideas.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Here is a summary of the Foundation's Financial performance for the
       first eight months of FY19:

       Operating Cash on Dec 31st, 2018 was $2,326.8K, which is up  $120.9K
       from last month's ending balance (Nov 18) of $2,205.9K.    Total Cash
       as of Dec 31st, 2018 is $3,720.7K ( includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation) as compared to $1,663.1K on Dec 31st 2017. The
       Dec 2018 ending Operating cash balance of $2,326.8K represents an
       Operating cash reserve of 15.5 months based on the FY19 conservative
       Cash forecast average monthly spending of $150.3K/month.  The ASF
       actual Operating reserve of 15.5 months at the end of Dec 2018 is
       ahead of the budgeted 10.6 month reserve for YTD through Dec 2018. 
       The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF's size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income,  was ahead of FY 18, at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $326.1K .  As compared to the FY 19
       Budgeted Income,  YTD,  we are ahead by $412.7K.

       YTD expenses, through Dec 31st, 2018 are under budget by $296.0K.  All
       depts. are under budget, at the end of Dec 2018.  There are still a
       couple items worth mentioning, one being Infra,  as noted in the Board
       summary is $167.9K under budget due to the timing of hiring of staff
       and not having to pay any Lease web invoices YTD.  The other being TAC
       at $45K under budget YTD for FY19.  We have moved most of the dept
       underspending forward in the Cash forecast and will be reviewing the
       underspending with the departments as we move forward in FY19 Q3.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $267.6K NI vs a budgeted negative <$441.1K> NI or $708.7K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments offset by more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in all depts
       YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are doing very
       well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking
       timing variances into account.  We will continue to monitor this as we
       move further into FY19.  With regard to FY18, we are outpacing revenue
       but are also out pacing expenses $206.3K. Thus, year over year NI
       exceeds FY18 by $119.8K, and is significantly ahead of FY19 budget in
       all categories.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of Secretary is running well.

       The Secretary represented The ASF at the Flink Forward conference in
       Beijing, China in December and delivered the keynote speech.

       In December, 69 ICLAs, one CCLA, and three grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       =============

       Infrastructure is operating as expected.

       Hiring remains an ongoing activity.

       Preparations continue for a long range plan to upgrade Puppet to V6
       and OS to Ubuntu LTS 18.04.

       65 projects/325 repositories have voluntarily migrated from git-wip-us
       to gitbox since Nov 2018. gitbox now has 172 projects/1300
       repositories. As of Jan 15th 50 projects/175 repositories remain on
       git-wip-us. Voluntary migrations to minimize disruption are ongoing.
       Forced migrations will take place on Feb 7th.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Work has begun on restructuring and refining the strategy for ASF
       Fundraising.

       Via ComDev a proposal has been submitted for recognizing non-technical
       contributions to Apache communities.

       Planning is underway for our 20th anniversary celebrations. A
       community-wide survey (closing Feb 15th) has been published - “The
       Apache Way To Me…” https://s.apache.org/oxTr


       Conferences
       ===========

       ApacheConNA discussions with a potential producer continue.

       Chicago roadshow has been announced, CFP is open.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       TAC are exploring ways that they can better help ASF attendance at
       other, such as FOSSDEM. Interested folks should look out for proposals
       from TAC in the coming month or so.

       No events in process at present.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues to support and add value to the foundation and KAM is
executing on the tasks for a graceful exit. His work will be divided up among
a combination of increased hours for HALO, new work for Virtual and a
freelancer is being sought for event fundraising.

Our monthly committee meetings continue with our last meeting on Jan 10th. New
meetings will be standing meetings on the 2nd Thursday of the month.  The time
of day is being discussed by the committee.

There is no major change in event fundraising to report beyond talks continue
and final prospectuses are needed for the ACNA, ACEU and Chicago Roadshow
events.

Financially, we continue to add more sponsors and fundraising goals are being
met or exceeded.  With the ASF running under budget, gaining more sponsors and
some early sponsor payments, we are now $708K ahead of budget based on Net
Income for the Fiscal Year to Date.

With the current budget and reserves, we have jumped from 10.5 to 15.5 months
of operational monies in our operating accounts.  Adding the additional monies
from Pineapple and the restricted donation earmarked for the endowment we
could consider that an additional 9.3 months in reserve by our calculations.

Finally, total cash as of Dec 31st, 2018 is $3,720.7K as compared to
$1,663.1K on Dec 31st 2017 representing a $2,057.6K increase in one year.

include a separate line item for promotional materials at third party events
supported by Apache Community Development.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi has begun to work on restructuring
and refining the strategy for ASF Fundraising, with thanks to co-VP Kevin
McGrail for his many efforts since the beginning of FY2018. Sally also
submitted her proposed process for recognizing non-technical contributions,
and will be working with Apache Community Development on its launch. The
latest "Success at Apache" post, "Accidentally Finding Awesome", has been
published at https://s.apache.org/e3is . We also published our first ASF
Sponsor case study, in collaboration with Bloomberg https://s.apache.org/jKNc.
The end-of-year summary, "Apache in 2018 - By The Digits", has been published
at https://s.apache.org/Apache2018Digits . Sally is also planning several
tactics for the ASF's 20th Anniversary, and has published a community-wide
survey on "The Apache Way To Me..." https://s.apache.org/oxTr (ongoing;
deadline 15 February 2019).

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this

Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 234 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 15 items, and have 51.3K followers on
Twitter. We posted 12 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 29.2K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 3 media queries. The ASF received 1,189
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,385. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,697 press hits vs. last month's 2,955. ApacheCon received 6
press hits. We also worked with several corporates with strong ties to various
Apache projects on branding adherence as well as publishing blog posts in
support of milestone announcements. We are also helping a PMC with an issue
with an account on Twitter.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no analyst queries during this time.
Apache was mentioned in 6 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 2
reports by 451 Research; and 6 reports by IDC.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Finances
========
Infrastructure's 5-year budget forecast was completed, and is included
in this month's President's report.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Hire new people.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move to Puppet 6. Most of the infrastructure currently runs on v3,
  with a couple older systems still on v2. We have been lifting
  non-puppet systems to v3 over the past two years, during our
  migration away from ASF hardware into the cloud. v6 planning,
  design, and initial implementation has been in-progress for about a
  year (v5 for most of that, and v6 recently). This tooling will be
  paired with upgrades to Ubuntu LTS 18.04 (most of our systems run on
  LTS 16.04 and LTS 14.04). Rollout of v6/18.04 will begin this year.

General Activity
================
- Moved to Slack. The Infra team's locus of activity has relocated
  from HipChat to Slack. Our users have been invited to the new chat
  system for quick queries and requests.
- Completed migration away from zmanda backup software. All backups
  are now rsync-based.
- Jenkins and its plugins were upgraded just before New Years. One of
  the Jenkins master's drives went offline and was replaced. We had
  eight minutes of downtime for the drive replacement, and two hours
  while Jenkins started itself back up.
- Continued work on a new "hermes" (aka our core email transfer
  agent). Our test system is now running on Puppet v6.
- Various refinements of our monitoring/status/paging systems with our
  Slack setup and usage.

Git-Wip-US -> GitBox Migration
==============================
Migration from git-wip-us to gitbox was announced in November 2018,
starting with voluntary coordination between projects and infra, and
forced migration on February 7th for remaining projects.
 
During the current migration time frame, from November till now, around
65 projects have moved some 325 repositories across to gitbox
voluntarily, and coordinated with infra, so as to minimize downtime and
work disruption. As of January 15th, approximately 150 repositories,
covering 50 projects, remain on git-wip-us, while 1300 repositories,
covering 175 projects, are on gitbox. Thus, the split is ~90% of all
repositories on gitbox and 10% remaining on git-wip-us.
 
We have sent out an additional email to all remaining projects on
git-wip today (Tuesday Jan 15th), three weeks before the forced
migration, to see if we can coordinate migration with them on a
voluntary basis and in a non-disruptive way before the deadline.
 
On February 7th, we will conduct a mass migration of the remaining
repositories, as well as a major spring cleaning of repositories belong
to retired podlings or attic'ed TLPs.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America 2019 is progressing well, with planning
meetings happening with the producer, and both a timeline and a budget
being discussed.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Travel Assistance Report - January 2019
------------------------------------------------------

Event Activity
------------------ 
No events since the last report. No upcoming events. Next
planned events are ACNA and ACEU taking place in the next
financial year.

Financial
------------ 
Last week our 5 year plan budget as requested by the President
was submitted. No change in the next 5 years has been requested
and all remain steady at $65K per financial year. (To support 2 x
ApacheCon and up to 3 x smaller events)

TAC Membership
----------------------- 
No changes to the TAC membership

General Activity
--------------------- 
We had received an inquiry from ASF folks involved in the ASF participation at 
FOSDEM 2019.

They asked about the possibility of sending 2 folks - familiar with the ASF,
either already committers or regular contributors - to attend FOSDEM and help
spread the word about the ASF and its projects to a potential audience of over
5000 attendees while also themselves learning more about the Apache community
and help them and others further pursue our nonprofit mission. This could
involve attending sessions, staffing the ASF booth for periods of time and
generally being everywhere talking to as many people as possible during their
time there.

The financial aspect of it would be something like transport and accommodation
for 2 or 3 days for 2 people - these would ideally be within a train or short
flight away.

While we deemed it too late to get a proper review and approval process going
for FOSDEM 2019, we have begun discussions around 3rd party events and how TAC
can help people and in doing so help the foundation with its mission.

We have always had budget for non ApacheCon events ($15K for up to 3 x such
events) we have not moved forward on this and so we are starting to explore
what is possible - and acceptable to our 501c3 status.

I hope we can get this ironed out and have at least one event achieved
hopefully during this FY as we have plenty of budget left to do so.

Short/Medium Term Priorities
---------------------------------------

Work through getting a workflow and judging/scoring process in place to suit
non ApacheCon events.

Compile a list of non ApacheCon events that we should look to consider
supporting.

Continue the discussion on directed sponsorship Revisit the criteria for
accepting recipients for ApacheCon

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

Legal Affairs committee for the past month has been mostly business as usual
with an average number of LEGAL jiras coming in and requiring our attention.
Assistant V.P., Legal Affairs and other members of a legal committee have been
doing excellent job at triaging legal JIRAs and making sure we make progress
on addressing our backlog. We are currently at 28 open (compared to 24 last
month) JIRAs  with the oldest dating back to Jan 2017.

While we seem to be keeping on top of day-to-day issues that come up, it must
be noted that JIRA count is creeping a bit up and a few things that were
expected to be resolved in the month of December and put to rest (e.g. mailing
list structure, binary releases and CCLAs) are still lingering. Hopefully the
month of January will see us getting a few of those across the finish line (I
hope to have a bit more time available to dedicate to making a dent in those).

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airflow Project  [Bolke de Bruin]

## Description:
 - Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically
   author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as
   code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and
   collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs
   (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of
   workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line
   utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user
   interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production,
   monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.


## Issues:

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Francis Chuang]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Calcite 1.18 was released towards the end of December with significant
enhancements to the SQL dialect: JSON functions, linear regression functions
and the WITHIN GROUP clause for aggregate functions.

Avatica 1.13 was released in early December and included numerous bug fixes,
upgraded dependencies and docker images for the HSQLDB flavor of Avatica.

The PMC Chair was switched from Michael Mior to Francis Chuang on Dec 21 2018,
following the project's tradition of rotating the PMC chair each year.

We continue to have a steady amount of contributions from new and existing
community members.

All of our git repositories (calcite, calcite-avatica and calcite-avatica-go)
were migrated to gitbox.

Finally, the project received a lot of excellent contributions, but a number
of them were not able to be merged into the Calcite 1.18 release due to pull
requests not being reviewed in a timely manner.

## Health report:
Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both Calcite and
Avatica.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CarbonData Project  [Liang Chen]

## Description:

- The Apache CarbonData is an indexed columnar store solution for fast
  analytics on Big Data platforms (including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,
  among others) to help speed up queries an order of magnitude faster over
  petabytes of data, with the aim of using a unified file format to satisfy
  all kinds of data analysis cases.

## Board comment in the last report:
rb : A reprise of a comment from an earlier month: You refer to active
contributors from 30+ organizations, and 130 contributors, but you then
mention only 19 committers. Who are these contributors, and are you actively
considering which of them may become committers? Don't make the mistake of
setting the bar so high that these contributors go away feeling that they have
not received the recognition that they've earned!

reply : Thanks for the kind reminder. Sure, we will actively identify the
active contributors to become committers. Last month,the CarbonData community
had 1 new committer and 1 new PMC.

## Issues:

- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Community is pretty active, contributors who are from many different
  organizations , and now the number of contributors is more than 140+, we are
  receiving around 200 pull requests per month.
- We are focus on the two releases(1.5.1 and 1.5.2) in the last 3 months,
  which provided many significant features, such as : integration with spark
  2.3.2 and hadoop 3.1.1, improve scan performance, support modify column name
  after table created,  support C++ Interfaces with multi-threads to Query
  Data from CarbonData, further optimize complex data type, support gzip
  compressor to get better compression ratio etc.
- The community helped many users to test carbondata and deploy carbondata in
  production via mailing list.
- Meetup(Carbondata+Spark) be organized in shenzhen on 1st Dec, 2018 , the
  onsite attendees is more than 100 persons, the online attendees(internet) is
  more than 300 persons.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 - Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop. 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - Had a few issues files this quarter related to extensions/fixes to better
 integrate with object stores (like S3) at the end of MapReduce jobs with a
 patch promised from a developer who has made some small contributions to
 the project in the past and looks like an excellent candidate to become
 a committer in the near future.
   
## Health report: 
 - The needs of the community are largely unchanged and are mainly focused
 on integrating legacy MapReduce jobs with cloud platforms that only use
 HDFS as a caching layer while persisting data for the long-term in object
 storage; there isn't much other work to do on the core of the Crunch system
 aside from these compatibility updates and the occasional bug fix.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

The main activity this quarter was centered around Java 11 support.
We're hoping to get 3.3 out in the next week or two which will have initial
support for Java 11.   The new Maven coordinates for the Jakarta based
J2EE specs have caused some confusion and concern which did start
a few discussions.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
 - SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Per sub-project:

 - ApacheDS: low activity: Mostly changes due to LDAP API refactoring.
             Nice contribution to upgrade cache library received.
             Release planned.
 - LDAP API: good activity: Heavy refactoring of request/response
             encoding. Improvements in TLS certificate error handling.
             Contribution to upgrade commons library received. Release
             planned.
 - Studio:   good activity: Removal of JNDI abstraction layer and
             bugfixes. Release planned. 
 - Fortress: good activity: Release of 2.0.3. Added JSON/REST
             interface and started work on a new web UI.
 - Kerby:    low activity: Release preparations for 2.0.0 finished,
             issues detected during vote are already resolved
 - Mavibot:  no activity
 - SCIMple:  low activity: Not much activity after code contribution
             and inital release process discussion.

## Health report:

  Overall development activity (commits, development related mails,
  resolved issues, releases) was lower than previous quarter. There
  is no specific reason, just less time developers could spend on
  the project.

  The new SCIMple sub-project didn't have a good start. After the
  code contribution there was almost no activity from the initial
  contributors. Instead two bugfix releases of the old project were
  created. On the other hand new people are interested. All in all
  not alarming yet, but the PMC needs to continue to give advice
  and guidance to the new sub-project.

  After long time a new committer was voted in.

  In good old tradition the PMC decided to rotate the chairman, see
  related resolution.

  The PMC feels the project is healthy.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Vishwas Babu A J]

## Description:
Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
The Fineract community maintains two active projects Fineract 1.x - Current
generation product which is widely used FIneract-CN (including microservices
front end UI) - Next Generation framework which is still under active
development and has been officially released Release management on Fineract
1.x was largely led by contributors associated with "The Mifos Initiative".
For 2019, the indications are that these contributors shall be shifting their
attention to Fineract-CN. The PMC shall be closely monitoring the impact of
the same on the ability of the community to continue shipping timely releases
and responding to security issues raised around Fineract 1.x.

Signs of disengagement have been observed within the community due to lack of
clarity on the long term plans around Fineract 1.x and on-going delays in
releasing the initial version of Fineract-CN. Committers are initiating work
on publishing a roadmap for Fineract-CN which would answer key questions like
"would Fineract-CN be a drop-in replacement for Fineract 1.* ?" and provide
target timelines for key feature availability (and possibly feature parity
with commonly used modules in Fineract 1.x) on Fineract-CN.

## Activity:

Fineract 1.x A major release (1.2) has been shipped and committers are working
on shipping version 1.3 targeted for the 2nd week of January 2019

Fineract-CN Ongoing activity led by Isaac Kamga around improving build time
and ensuring license compliance in preparation for an initial release.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Misty Linville]

## Description:

Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
database. Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows
with millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware.

hbase-thirdparty is a set of internal artifacts used by the project to
mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

## Issues:

## Activity:

There have been lots of interesting discussions on the dev@ mailing list.
Highlights:
- Discussion is ongoing about plans to move to Gitbox and ways the project can
  accommodate users who prefer to contribute using Github.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3496568d  6cc002f74f5c3bcce46ed44b7ee9e90d7d53af2c65b6f785@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- An interesting discussion occurred about the frequency of releases in the
  2.1.x line
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/222aacbf7  4d9788287ef5606fe66a06c1a3aa31a299a469d124a5ee0@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E).
  The discussion included a sub-discussion about what it will take to separate
  the hbck took from the main project, and another sub-discussion about
  time-based releases and release cadence in general. It's worth a read.
- A proposal to retire the 1.3 line resulted in Francis Liu stepping in to be
  the release manage for the line, because his team relies on that branch.
  Francis is aiming for a quarterly release cadence. In the same discussion,
  Andrew Purtell and Sean Busbey discuss how they have been managing 1.2 and
  1.4 lines, and plans for the 1.5 line.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/dd655a21  cb5eb23a983648d71f5d08ca567b110ab9128a70f06eddcc@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- Another discussion of 1.x release cadences was started by Andrew Purtell,
  including specific plans for the 1.5 branch.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e18266c8  aa1e1406f3e652a3a1ee52d498aaad506537621cc754499b@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- Another interesting discussion resulted in improved understanding and
  documentation of the process for editing and rebuilding pages on the HBase
  website that don't result from building the documentation.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/18010d08  97752db7f9d91f4f75694831a7ed9db28739ce4a91e546e4@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- Speaking of 1.5, the first snapshot is available for testing.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/bbf7b479  20da532535bb8ce493df3265fd91211b227f681b2cc3c3a2@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)

Josh Elser started a discussion on the PMC list about the definition of and
parameters for an HBaseCon event, who can run one, and other guidelines,
informed by his work organizing HBaseCon US 2018. He's working on some
project-facing documentation, which promises to be helpful for future
organizers of HBase-related events worldwide.

The HBase project is working toward the goal of more frequent minor releases
and fewer unprompted maintenance releases. In total this quarter, HBase had 8
releases over this quarter, across 5 release lines.

Another goal, spanning several quarters, is to solicit more non-binding votes
on release candidates, as non-binding votes are one signal of broader
community engagement. Here are a few examples:
- HBase 1.3.3 RC0 had 40% non-binding votes
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9e3a472e  142faa9a48ed5ab0e1e1baaaeb9ddfe7a9fdcfa547c2cd20@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- HBase 1.4.8 RC0 had 50% non-binding votes
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2f8ad79f  6da4d2ac223a61b82aeb29a2322479257f271da90f0687e0@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- HBase 2.1.1 RC0 also had 50% non-binding votes
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f9ccc377  dbeac4b3a7a0cddcef0cd7369675f5b1cc570b6c19a52864@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)

As a reminder, anyone on the dev@ list can test and provide feedback on a
release candidate, and cast a non-binding vote.

Lars Hofhansl is in the process of organizing a bay-area HBase developer
meet-up at Salesforce. If you're interested, participate in the thread.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e814054e8d8ad1c5ebb30b9c50d97b5b8b5edada121f184fdf045e3d@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)

Two new committers were added this quarter, and two committers joined the PMC.
More details below. Thanks to the new committers and PMC members for agreeing
to take on more responsibilities in the project.

## Health report:

Despite a slow holiday quarter, the HBase project shows a high level of
engagement, as seen through release cadence, deep and meaningful discussion on
mailing lists, discussion and documentation of processes, and non-binding
votes in the project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 44 PMC members.
 - Zach York was added to the PMC on November 15, 2018.
 - Allan Yang was added to the PMC on Mon Nov 26 2018.

{{{
Incubator PMC report for January 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 51 podlings incubating. During the month of December,
podlings executed 8 distinct releases. We added 8 new IPMC members and 
had no IPMC members retire. The mentor situation has continued to improve 
but we still have a number of podlings with less than 3 mentors.

Apache Airflow graduated and several podlings are heading towards 
graduation. An incubator exit interview was sent to Airflow and the IPMC 
got some feedback on the incubating process. It highlighted a known 
issue with releases that needs to be made clear to mentors and PPMCs (as a 
number of podlings have recently run into the same issue). A discussion 
will 
be started soon about this.

Several new podlings are off to a slow start. BatchEE is still stuck in 
performing the last graduation steps, but the PPMC have said they will get 
to it in February.

One new podling Iceberg reported very late. Both podlings that failed to
report last month reported this month.

There were 2 IP clearances.

A meeting was held with Superset to discuss its issues and good progress 
was made. The meeting notes were posted back to the dev list, teh project 
still has not made an Apache release.

It was noticed that MXNet was also making unapproved releases and had some 
branding and policy issues, the MXNet PPMC have taken action to fix some 
the issues.

Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing configuration management and 
deployment for Big Data Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:
Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests.
A repository to store those packaged applications: the applications 
repository.
A repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for 
instance, the location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the 
configuration repository.
A dashboard to monitor the pipelines.
A DSL and integration hooks allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow up user and contributor communities
  2. Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?

  There is still concern regarding the progress of the project, a 
  discussion was re-initiated by one of the mentors recently and is currently 
  ongoing.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new contributor have contributed code that have been merged. In 
  addition, we are actively looking for more use cases and organizations to 
  use Amaterasu.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * 4 pull requests have been opened since the last report and 4 have been 
  merged
  * Since last report 9 more issues have been created and 4 out of them 
  have been assigned

Date of the last release:

  12 July 2018

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and 
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Release initial versions
  2. Add active contributors
  3. Demonstrate good governance through voting on process improvements.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The last quarter saw the departure of a couple previous mentors (due to 
  their overall
  workloads being too high in general). They have been replaced by two new 
  mentors
  who are getting familiar with Apache Annotator and its needs.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We remain a small (probably too small) team, and continue to reach out to 
  potential
  contributors--folks who had expressed interest in building the Apache 
  Annotator community
  and code, but who have yet to participate. We will be doing more to 
  encourage more
  involvement in 2019--especially leading up to http://iannotate.org/ (a 
  significant annotation focused event).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Coding and discussion activity have continued to remain at low levels. We 
  will be working
  on setting some achievable targets for features and release in 2019 in 
  hopes of moving that needle.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

     Comments: Memory is hazy (I've been unwell the past week).  I think 
     the above is a fair summary: the successful effort to recruit new mentors 
     was a positive episode.  The subject of growing the PMC has been raised, 
     and the project wishes to distinguish between those with a real interest 
     (PMC) vs those whose contributions may have been of a more drive-by nature 
     but who might nevertheless be made committers.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: Are there any plans to make a release? Incubating for 2
  years without a release is a long time. Can you also state if your
  mentors have been helpful.

--------------------
BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka
JSR352) and a set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Main issue is finishing the graduation, we will get a small discussion 
  to check it is what we want to do (vs giving back the project to geronimo)
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Justin Mclean: Given that 92% of commit are from non-committers why does
  the project not vote more committers in? I can only see one committer 
  voted in in the previous year. For a project nearing graduation I'd expect
  to see a lot more people voted in. I also don't see what is discussed in the
  video conferences being brought back to the list.

--------------------
Iceberg

Iceberg is a table format for large, slow-moving tabular data.

Iceberg has been incubating since 2018-11-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish the name clearance and trademark agreement.
  2. Make the first Apache release. 
(https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/milestone/1)
  3. Grow the Iceberg community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Gitbox traffic is now going to issues@. The community was losing dev@ 
    subscribers because of the high volume of traffic from Gitbox. However,
    now all updates are sent to issues@. It would be nice to have emails
    from creation go to dev@, while updates and resolutions would go the
    issues@.
  * The trademark agreement proposed by Netflix was not acceptable to the 
    ASF. It would be helpful if the ASF published the terms that the ASF
    requires to avoid trial and error. Netflix is drafting a new agreement.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Moved gitbox notifications to avoid loss of dev@ subscribers 
  (self-reported leaving dev@).
  * New contributor activity: 3 new issues opened, 4 PRs submitted
  * 5 PRs from non-committers merged
  * 2 contributors started reviewing PRs
  * New design doc proposed by a community contributor
  * Moved issues from Netflix repository to Apache repository

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Planned blockers for first release, 0.1.0, in milestone 1
  * Partial python implementation submitted
  * Manifest listing file added to the spec and implementation committed 
  (blocker for initial release). Resulted in a significant improvement in 
  query planning time for large tables.
  * Abstracted file IO API to support community use cases
  * Reviewing community proposal for external plugins to support file-level 
  encryption
  * Added doc strings to schemas

Livy

Livy is web service that exposes a REST interface for managing long running
Apache Spark contexts in your cluster. With Livy, new applications can be
built on top of Apache Spark that requires fine grained interaction with 
many
Spark contexts.

Livy has been incubating since 2017-06-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community to have more activities.
  2. Grow more contributors and committers.
  3. Regular release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Activity has waned a little bit since the last report. Most of new 
  activity has been to stabilize a new feature (Hive-compatible Thrift
  server). Committer activity remains a bit low.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Mainly small bug fixes and stabilization of new code.

Marvin-AI

Marvin-AI is an open-source artificial intelligence (AI) platform that helps
data scientists, prototype and productionalize complex solutions with a
scalable, low-latency, language-agnostic, and standardized architecture
while simplifies the process of exploration and modeling.

Marvin-AI has been incubating since 2018-08-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.Move development infrastructure to Apache
  2.Build Community
  3.Build Releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The project began to receive help from community members (not PPMC
  members) more actively with the development of the project site.
  * The community started discussing contribution patterns in the
  repository and came up with some good practices that should be followed
  * A new member is being included as a contributor to the project. Only a
  few details are missing for inclusion.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * A new code repository was created for the development of the project
  site following the Apache template.
  * Bug fixes were done in the code and in the project documentation.
  * Some PoC's to a new Toolbox version was included to a new branch on the
  repo.

Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling
through the cracks? In the latter case, please list any open issues

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Rebuild the team
  2. Edit the code for the first release
  3. Expand the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to beaware 
of?

  We need continuous support to restart the project management and to make 
  the code released.

  This project have been stalled for several month because initial 
  committers from Miracl unfortunately stopped activities from external 
  reasons.  
  It seems we should assume they will take more time to settle their 
  situation.
  We already have a set of codes that will work as the initial product, and 
  it will need some editorial (and possibly legal?) efforts to release.
  The idea of retirement was put to the vote and was rejected, and we are 
  working for restarting.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Some people are joining the community to the restart the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We worked for the first release of the crypt library part, and have been 
  stalled because of the lack of knowledge about the release process.  
  It seems we need clarification on the release process mainly from the 
  legal aspects.

addressed.

  Mentors are helpful in starting the restart.
  The remaining members still lack very basic information about the 
  management in ASF, so we need continuous help.

  The project's open issues are:
  (1) Recover the team’s communication
  (2) Give access to the official repository for committers who already 
  signed ICLA,
  (3) List all the repositories that contain codes for this project,
  (4) Analyze status of each repository, possibly including legal status
  (5) Edit and merge the code and push to the official repository.
  (6) Release

  We need help and guide by mentors to address the issues from the 
  following aspects:
  (A) Input on Apache's process, source of information, or use of the 
  toolset,
  (B) Helpful facilitation for communication with PMCs and the community,
  (C) Guide how the output code/document should be.

  Mentors or a person who will lead the communication are requested to 
  submit a ping message on the mailing list regularly that asks any 
blockers.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean:Rather than asking the mentors to ping you I suggest you ask
  any question you have on the mailing list. If they are not answered or you
  need further help please ask on the general@ incubator list.
  I'm also concerned about the lack of discussion on the mailing list as a
  number of things mentioned above don't seem to have occurred on the list.

MXNet

A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large 
  percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from 
  other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for establishing 
  a healthy Apache community.
  2. With PLC4X several people on the team are not very familiar with the 
  Apache Way. We have started and will continue our efforts on this 
  onboarding.
  3. Make others in the PPMC able to perform releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Not at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have managed to get some more people to contribute. While we are still 
  waiting for the initial contribution (OPC-UA Server) of one person to be 
  submitted, we were just able to successfully integrate another first code 
  contribution into our build which seeds the C++ API module (Thanks to 
  Markus Sommer for this).

  Github notes the number of contributors has gone up to 12 … so I think 
  we’re looking good as we are continuously getting more people on board, 
  hopefully soon also into committership and PPMC involvement.

  In the last quarter of 2018 Christofer Dutz had several public talks on 
  PLC4X:

  * 09.10.2018: “Between the towers” Meetup, Frankfurt
  * 24.10.2018: “Oss Summit Europe” Conference, Edinburgh
  * 13.11.2018: “3. Fachkonferenz - Big data in der Industire“ Conference, 
  Berlin
  * 15.11.2018: „RheinJUG“ Meetup, Düsseldorf
  * 06.12.2018: „IoTHessen“ Meetup, Frankfurt

  From 22.11.2018-26.11.2018 we had our second official community event: 
  This  time we meet at the codecentric finca on Mallorca for 4 days of
  hacking, coding, discussions and community building.

  All in all 3 PPMC members participated and one new person.

  On 03.12.2018 we successfully released: Version 0.2.0 (RC1) and we’re 
  currently working on enabling new release-managers for the next release.

  Our mailing list subscriptions went up another 4 to currently 42 
  subscribers.

  Our Twitter followers increased by 57 (almost doubled) to 116 followers 
  (Mainly as a direct result of @Java tweeting about us).

  On GitHub we now have 42 “Stars” (increase of 18) and 20 “Forks” 
  (increase of 6)

  We have successfully performed two major POCs with customers from the 
  industry (Companies in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors) and the 
  results where overwhelming.

  We are expecting to see more adoption in 2019. Also are we trying to 
  convince companies to allow us to officially talk about what we did in 
  order to spread the word.

  Also have we had first paid contracts where the companies were paying 
  members of the project to implement some general purpose features that 
  were missing as well as bug fixing and allowing those results to become
  part of the open-source project (Which I think is pretty surprising as
  the concept of Open-Source is quite new to these companies)

  How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people involved.

  So far, the new participants have shown great willingness and success in 
  adopting the Apache Way.
  However, we still need to continue: the on-boarding increasing the 
  diversity of the team.
  Also we are currently trying to enable other team members to take over 
  vital roles (Like being a release manager) so we no longer have areas 
  with personal singularities.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built 
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple 
nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

SensSoft

Apache SensSoft has been incubating since 2016-07-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Extending release process to other parts of the SensSoft software 
  stack.
  2. Grow the Apache SensSoft (Incubating) Committer/Community Base.
  3. Complete the issues highlighted at the SensSoft Roadmap [1]

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  Following a successful VOTE in favor of changing the Podling name [2], 
  the community submitted 12 nominations for new Podling names [2]. The names 
  are collected for easy reference on our confluence space [3].  The community 
  downselected the names [2] JIRA tickets have been written to track 
  progress on research on PODLINGNAMESEARCH board [4].  

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been:
  - discussing reaching out to other open source projects to identify other

ShardingSphere

Sharding-Sphere is an ecosystem of transparent distributed database
middleware, focusing on data sharding, distributed transaction and database
orchestration.

ShardingSphere has been incubating since 2018-11-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move codebase to Apache after last not apache release version for 3.x.
  2. Upload website.
  3. First ASF release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Invite new mentor: Von Gosling(vongosling.apache.org)
  2. Meetup for ShardingSphere with mentors and PPMC at 12.21

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Released 3.1.0.M1, contributors are from different companies. In 3.1.0.M1 
  release milestones, there are 148 issues and pull requests solved. This 
is 
  a legacy release not for Apache.

Weex

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. A clear roadmap and corresponding project management, which should all 
  be public and transparent to the community
  2. Committers & PPMC members should be more activate and response in time 
  when dealing with Email, Github Issue/Pull request
  3. More activate committers & PPMC members outside Alibaba Group.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  The development of Weex is based on the Weex Github Repo, but none of the 
  PPMC members have maintainer or administration privilege on the 
  repo (https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex), which makes it time 
  costing or impossible to add Webhook、PR Review Rules, etc. as INFRA member
  might response to a JIRA issue several days or weeks later.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  New Committer: Qianyuan Wang(wqyfavor) and Douma Fang
  75 Github issues solved/closed since last report, 56 issues still open.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  Released a new version (v0.20.0)
  131 PRs since last report

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description: 
Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java. Users only write POJOs and Apache Isis handles the database and UI
automatically at runtime.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We did a release of version 1.17.0 of the framework [1]. 

More broadly, 1.x codebase continues to get small enhancements, a couple of
noticeable ones being the new sidebar dialog and also the ability to export
the entire metamodel as XML.  These enhancements are being forward ported
into the 2.x branch.

Most of the development effort is in the 2.x branch, with efforts underway
to be able to re-platform the framework on top of both JEE Microprofile or
Spring Boot, in other words to throw away as much "proprietary code" as
possible in order to leverage these platforms.  This will also hopefully
enable the backend ORM to be come fully pluggable, to therefore support
both DataNucleus (as currently) and also Spring Data.
   
## Health report: 

We consider the project to be healthy with PMC members participating in
votes and both project members and users exchanging questions and answers 
on the dev and users mailing lists.

Announcements on the user list and requests for comments are responded to,
confirming that we also have community engagement.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description ==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

jclouds continues to accumulate bug fixes but little feature work.  Notably we
are struggling with Java 8/newer Guava compatibility which vexes our users. We
continue to work with the Karaf community on one of these issues.  This blocks
release of jclouds 2.2.0. We have migrated our source repositories to Gitbox,
and will be deprecating and archiving the legacy jclouds GitHub org in such a
way as to allow contributors to migrate easily. We've also moved our CI
infrastructure from CloudBees DEV@cloud to the ASF Jenkins installation. One
consequence of that is that we have been able to results of our live tests
public, which will be valuable to the community.

== Community ==

Outside the existing PMC and committers, we had 12 contributors this quarter
(including several new ones) and more activity on our issue tracker. Notably,
one potential contributor sent a pull request for a new Aliyun OSS provider,
but this will require significant rework to merge. It is important to note
that these kinds of large pull requests are difficult to review, and it may
take more time than desired to guide and educate the contributors, since most
of the PMC and committers are now "pure" volunteers (with $dayjob no longer
related to jclouds).

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez) 
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21(Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Unblock the release of jclouds 2.2.0, which will provide Java 8 support. Keep
engaging contributors on Slack, and propose them as new committers as
appropriate. Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources to properly
manage the project.

== Releases == 

The last jclouds release, 2.1.1, took place on 2018-08-16.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The project has just voted for a release 3.10.0 in line with the 3-4 month
cycle (as and when volunteer time is available).

The git repo has been migrated seamlessly to gitbox - an excellent process by
INFRA.

The project has received a significant contribution of a GeoSPARQL
implementation and the team is migrating from the custom spatial query
solution to the Open Geospatial Consortium standards-based one.

The project is also retiring some unused modules that do not receive attention
and have had very little in the way of user questions over the last few years.
EMail to the users list to alert users of the intention has not received any
push-back for the first group of modules to be retired.

## Health report:

The project is at normal levels of activity, with JIRA and git pull requests
getting being responded to, and the users list remains active. There are also
many questions asked and answered on stackoverflow where answers come from a
wider community.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description:

 - Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
   Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues:

 - No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Kudu 1.8.0 was released on October 23rd, 2018, with support for a manual
   rebalancer that can be used to redistribute table replicas among tablet
   servers. The release also included the usual bevy of bug fixes and
   performance improvements, as well as some smaller features based on user and
   operator feedback from past releases.

## Health report:

 - User mailing list subscriptions didn't grow, and traffic is down about 25%
   this quarter, most likely due to US holidays. Questions are generally
   answered quickly and overall traffic is quite bursty.

 - Website traffic growth is down: about -7% for users and -9% for sessions
   since the last quarter. This is within our normal quarterly fluctuation.
   In the last board report we talked about reviving the Kudu blog to grow
   interest in the project, and although that hasn't happened yet, we do have
   several blog posts currently in review.

 - Development activity (measured by code review and JIRA traffic) is down
   somewhat (reviews -9%, JIRA -20%, commits +36%). Code was authored by
   16 unique contributors (-12 since last quarter) of whom 2 were new to the
   project (-7 since last quarter). Commit activity was inflated due to the
   1.8.0 release; the rest of the metrics reflect the fact that several key
   developers have tapered down their involvement in Kudu for various reasons.

 - In the last board report we wrote about how we're working on a process to
   publish test artifacts as part of Kudu releases. Progress has been made but
   the new process is not yet ready for primetime.

## PMC changes:

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:

- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
  for data scientists.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

- Last release was 1.15.1 which was the 5th release as an Apache TLP project.
  This was a minor release that included support for Ubuntu 16.04 as well as
  various feature improvements.

- Community is at work on the 1.16 release which is anticipated in the next
  month or so.  Key features are PostgreSQL 11 support, and a new method for
  k-NN nearest neighbors.

- Community is also at work on the 2.0 release at the same time, with good
  progress on a JIRA related to versioning models.

- On 2018-Oct-30, Nandish Jayaram (MADlib committer) and Frank McQuillan
(MADlib committer and PMC member) visited Arun Kumar, Assistant Professor of
 Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, San Diego
 regarding possible collaboration projects related to in-database machine
 learning. Discussions went well and we will report back to the community if
 this collaboration moves forward. Note that Professor Kumar is a former
 colleague of MADlib PMC Chair Aaron Feng when both were at the University of
 Wisconsin-Madison.

— Frank McQuillan (MADlib committer and PMC member) will be presenting at
  FOSDEM’19 on 2019-Feb-03 on deep learning on parallel databases, using
  MADlib and Greenplum Database as an example.


## Health report:

The community is relatively small but very engaged with robust mailing list
traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and new functionality being
developed by contributors.

The number of developers actively contributing to the code/documentation is
approximately 6 in the 4th quarter of calendar year 2018.

We will constantly be on a lookout for new community members to be invited
either as committers or PMC.


## PMC changes:

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Andrew Musselman]

## Description:
Apache Mahout is an environment for quickly creating scalable performant
machine learning applications.

## Issues:

No changes since last report.

## Activity:

The team are in the middle of a 0.14 release; first RC is being tested and
kinks ranging from the move to gitbox and left-over items that need to be
adjusted in Jenkins are being shaken out.

The PMC heard the advice from the board to consider adding committers and PMC
members; with the holidays and work pressures there has been less time than
usual to work on community efforts but we would like to grow the team this
quarter. Some conference activity at FOSDEM for example will be one route,
continued meetup sessions will be another.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - January 2019
---------------------------

## Description:

 - Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
   development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
   standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
   lifecycle.

## Issues:

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Activity:

  As you might see in the list of released plugins, surefire (the test
  execution framewok for Maven) is working on several milestones in order to
  make use of Maven3 API (drop Maven2 support) improve support of the modular
  system and JUnit5.

  Some plugins had to be updated for Java 11 support due to the changed
  bytecode version, but this is an activity we'll probably see every 6 months.

  Maven 3.6.0 has been released, most remarkable changes are:
  - Improved CI-friendly version support
  - New attributes for calculating proper URLs with interitence
  - Adjust caching for improved performance

## Health report:

  The community seems to be curious about the next major version(s) of Maven,
  especially when they are mentioned at mailing lists or social media by Maven
  committers. The ideas are around for a couple of years already, but with the
  daily acitivities on maintaining the project (responding to new issues and
  mailing lists) it is hard to find enough time and resources to start on
  Maven 4. However, we see a growth in interest, which might help us to
  attract new committers, and devide the work properly.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description:
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
There was concerted effort in creating the 0.7.0 release during this period.
This release contained substantially maturity of the UI components as well
as efforts around decoupling some of our infrastructural components from
the underlying distributed stream processing system (e.g. Storm).
Additionally, we have migrated to a more stable and future-proof API from
Elasticsearch.

## Health report:

We continued the good habits mentioned in the previous board report around
discussion of features.  I have not seen evidence justifying concerns around
Slack bleeding traffic from the mailing list.  Also, we continue to get
interesting and helpful user@ traffic showing real usage.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
   distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
   Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
   MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
   NiFi classloader isolation model.
 - Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
   components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
   applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Released Apache NiFi 1.8.0 containing numerous new features, bug fixes, and
   improvements. This included powerful features like load-balanced cluster
   aware connections and node decommissioning.
 - Discussions and work are underway to release the Apache NiFi Registry and
   necessary improvements to NiFi to support storing extensions in the
   registry and accessing them at run-time as needed via NiFi. This will
   reduce the size of our distribution greatly reducing burden on Apache
   infrastructure and improving the overall user experience.
 - Discussions and code review underway for a powerful and amazingly simple
   concept of NiFi flows executed as functions.  The model honors the NiFi API
   but offers wide variation in execution environments and will be useful for
   optimizing performance of certain common use cases.

## Health report:
 - Health of the community remains strong. Mailing list and JIRA activity has
   remains very active and we find the Apache NiFi slack channel increasing
   valuable as a tool to engage with the community and as a source of redirect
   to the mailing lists.
 - We have voted in two new committers in this period and there appears to be
   additional pipeline strength brewing as well for committer and PMC merit.

The last release on the 2.x branch (2.3.1) dates to Jan 20 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY
A discussion on the dev mailing list resulted in overall agreement to move the
build from Ant/Ivy to Maven - users are more adapted to Maven and we expect to
simplify the release procedure

The release of 1.16 should land in the next weeks with already 40 issues
resolved.


COMMUNITY

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik]

## Description:
   Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services
   orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues:
   The ODE PMC has successfully voted to move the project to Attic. Vote:
   https://s.apache.org/11Fv Result: https://s.apache.org/NegQ

   Project termination resolution has been added to the board agenda as item
   7B.

## Activity:
   An user on the mailing list came up with a new project proposal here
   [https://s.apache.org/rSlq], it's a completely new approach and is a
    definite canditate for the incubator as it gives an opportunity to build
    user and developer base around the new concept.

   As indicated in the last quarter report, we no more have an active user and
   developer base.

## Health report:
 - There has been not much user/dev activity since the last reporting period
   Oct
   2018.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
 relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
 compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
 OpenJPA runs in stand-alone Java SE as well as  containers e.g Java EE,
 Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.
 We are currently working on implementing the JPA-2.2 specification

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 Moving to GIT got us some more traffic. We also started adding Maven
 profiles to start up various databases via Docker. This heavily 
 simplifies contributing to different database dictionaries.
 We also had a discussion about what our 3.0.x line currently supports.
 We are right now a little bit in a limbo between JPA-2.0 and 2.2 due 
 to not having had access to the JPA TCK. We hope this will soon 
 become better as the JPA TCK is now freely available via JakartaEE.
 It is a lot work to adopt though, so we expect this to take up some
 months.

## Health report:
 Community is ok. I hope we get some bigger changes done due to the
 move to GIT. We've re-added Craig as PMC member as he got lost somehow
 in Whimsy. We are also discussing about 2 new PMC members.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two GA releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.5.18 - Bug fix release (2018-10-15)
* Struts 2.3.36 - Bug fix release (2018-08-22)

Furthermore, the Struts Team announced End-of-Life for the Struts 2.3.x
development line (2018-11-14)[1], effective on 2018-05-11. Struts 2.3.x
is guaranteed to receive security updates during the transition period.

Within the last quarter we saw increased development activity with over
50 closed pull requests. Work on a new release line 2.6.x has started,
with the plan to put 2.5.x in maintenance mode soon and EOL it within a
year’s period. Upcoming Struts feature releases  will be JDK 11
compatible. Currently we are in the process of releasing Struts 2.5.20
and 2.3.37.

Especially notable is the fact that quite a few new contributors are
showing up with mostly high quality contributions. We are keeping an eye
on these individuals for possible addition to the committership.

No committers or PMC members were added in the last quarter.

Last committer addition:
* 2017-11-14 - Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani)

Last PMC addition:
* 2018-06-12 - Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani)

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:
 - Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration efforts. The purpose of
   our project is to combine the power of the Apache web server with the
   capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl scripting language.
   Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively maintained.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Rivet released several artifacts (both in the 2.x and 3.x release
   channels), providing fixes to tickets created in the reporting period, and
   fixing problems surfaced by the test suite under various platforms.

 - The CMake build system was further developed, to perform all actions the
   autoconf based build system does, such as using the version from the
   VERSION file, and generating the correct pkgIndex.tcl file for the rivet
   library, after the library has been installed, in the installation
   directory.

 - The move to git (and integration to GitHub) has increased visibility, which
   along with the relatively new feature of supporting Apache HTTPD under
   Windows, raised some more interest from users (and not developers). Trying
   to help new users run rivet under Windows, revealed that building under
   Windows was been accidentally broken by the (re)addition of a preprocessor
   definition, and has not been detected. The bug has been fixed, and release
   of new artifacts is planned for early January.

 - As a response to the inability of rivet to link correctly under Windows, we
   tried to setup continuous integration for Windows through AppVeyor. This is
   still work in progress, as the needed webhooks could not be added to the
   rivet's GitHub project, and builds are currently triggered manually.

   As a temporary solution, a fork has been created in GitHub, which is synced
   periodically with its upstream through the "Pull" GitHub application. It
   provides some synchronisation, although it has a delay of several hours to
   trigger a build after a commit has been made. We are searching for a better
   solution.

 - Regarding comment from previous report:
   "It will be interesting to see if the move to git increased contribution
    levels. Please keep us updated." I think that the move to git has helped.
    The fact that it has eased integration with GitHub, which has automated
    tasks like monitoring commits
   (i.e. through e-mail notifications), creating and monitoring forks,
    applying patches through pull requests, etc. And for sure, has allowed the
    integration with CI tools, like AppVeyor and Travis (which is planned),
    which will help in detecting build problems under various operating
    systems earlier.

## Health report:
 - The project activity is limited to Apache Rivet.

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Description:

 - Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
   extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from,
   a growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
   types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and
   science data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop just completed the release process for 3.2.11, 3.3.5 and 
3.4.0. The 3.2.x line of code is largely closed off to general development
now with changes there reserved for the worst types of bugs. General 
development focus is currently on 3.3.5 and 3.4.0. While 3.3.5 has a few 
new features and bug fixes, 3.4.0 contains the culmination of nearly a 
year's worth of effort with large and important changes to the Gremlin 
graph traversal language.

Of particular general interest in 3.4.0, is the release of 
sparql-gremlin[1], which compiles SPARQL[2] queries into Gremlin so that
SPARQL can be executed on any TinkerPop-enabled graph system. In providing
this functionality, TinkerPop helps provide a bridge from the Semantic 
Web community with it's RDF model to TinkerPop's community with the 
property graph model.

The wider TinkerPop community saw some additional growth with two new
third-party libraries:

* gremlin-ide[3] an IDE for Apache TinkerPop enabled systems
* JUGRI[4] a Jupyter Gremlin Interface

In our last report, we mentioned that we were still awaiting acceptance
for an invitation sent to a new PMC member. That invitation has since been
accepted by Jorge Bay-Gondra.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.2.11 (January 2, 2019)
- 3.3.5 (January 2, 2019)
- 3.4.0 (January 2, 2019)

Attachment CD: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don't expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

Activity:
Much of the activity this quarter was around trying to get things building
and tests running with Java 11.  Also minor bug fixes for issues submitted
by users.  In general, not a lot of activity, but not much expected either.

PMC changes:
- Currently 42 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Alessio Soldano on Tue May 17 2016

Committer base changes:
- Currently 224 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Alessio Soldano at Sun Sep 14 2014

Releases this quarter:
* XmlSchema-2.2.4 was released on Sun Dec 09 2018
* Axiom-1.2.21 was released on Thu Nov 01 2018

Last releases for other technologies:
*  WSS4J 2.2.2 : Jun 2018
*  XmlSchema 2.2.4 : Dec 2018 (XML schema object model)
*  Neethi 3.1.1 : Jan 2018 (WS-Policy Framework)
*  Axiom  1.2.21 : Nov 2018 (StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model)
*  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)

Attachment CE: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release of the Xalan C/C++
library.

The libraries need little work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Our current chair no longer has the time to pursue PMC activities.
There is a need to assign a new chair person.

Active membership is becoming insufficient to hold binding votes.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

There has been some work to put patches into JIRA but we still need to get
the patches integrated into the XALAN-C for an update release.  The contributors
are active with other source projects and currently have little time to
devote on the Xalan C/C++ library.  There still is some activity devoted
to the Xalan Java library.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

The libraries need little work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
