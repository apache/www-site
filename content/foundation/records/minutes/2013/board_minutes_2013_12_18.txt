 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       As the Secretary reports, there are some PMCs that have not kept their
       records up to date after making PMC changes. Many of these have been
       followed through, but I intend to pick up an action to remind all PMCs
       to check their records, and to follow up any that may find
       discrepancies.

       There didn't appear to be a great demand for a mid-year members
       meeting when it was put forward in October, so I haven't pursued it
       any further. I expect we would hold the annual meeting in May again,
       and will start to canvas dates in the new year.

    B. President [Ross]
    
       A much quieter month for me. Things are progressing nicely on the
       ApacheCon front, huge thanks to Rich for ensuring this moves forwards.
       VP Brand Management is now engaged working on the correct trademarks
       agreements. Next stage will be for VP Legal Affairs to review the final
       contract (note, a first draft was shared on the board@ list on 12/16/13,
       we encourage Directors to provide feedback but Rich and I will
       coordinate with VP Legal Affairs, VP Brand Management and VP Marketing
       as appropriate.

       With respect to smaller event support Melissa is closing in on providing
       budget estimates for the "event in a box" concept. Next stage will be to
       work with the ComDev PMC to see if we feel the investment will be
       worthwhile and, if so, to start work on the supporting documentation
       while some old hands at ASF related events make use of the new
       supporting materials. I'm hoping to kick this off with a small community
       event here in Seattle in late Q1 (easily reachable from Portland and
       Vancouver).

       The Brazilian payment for trademark registration continues to elude us.
       I'm attempting to resolve this matter. The Audit list has been set up
       but there has been little progress to report at this point. Melissa
       stands ready to assist and I've asked her to attempt to pro-actively
       insert herself in the process once she spots things that she can help
       with.

       As discussed in the last months board meeting I would like to submit a
       revised budget request to cover an increase in Melissa's responsibilities.
       Please see Attachment BE for details, here is a summary of changes:
	   
       Increase Executive Assistant budget for FY ending Apr 30 2014 by 
       $15,500. This increases the deficit for this Financial Year to
       $34,841.
	   
       This deficit is clearly a concern and needs to be addressed but in the
       short term I believe we have the resources to address this deficit for
       many years to come. I intend to work with Fundraising to address this,
       especially in light of VP Branding Management desire for an increased 
       budget (see below for both items).
	   
       Special Order 7C calls for formal approval of the budget.
	          
       VP Trademarks has begun to revisit our trademark processes and as a
       result is expected to make a revised budget request. In parallel I have
       been contacted privately by two individual ASF Members expressing
       concern about flaws in our existing policy. In both cases I referred
       these members to the discussion Shane had already begun on the
       appropriate mailing list. I have heard nothing more and assume Shane's
       work has satisfied the concerns expressed. I am in full support of the
       recommendations from VP Brand Management and have requested that our EA
       support the effort in any way possible.       
       
       We received a late report from fundraising with no issues requiring
       board attention at this time. Now that the fundraising playbook has been 
       completed and our EA is providing support to VP Fundraising with respect 
       to day-to-day activities I intend to look at whether there is a need for
       more assistance in managing relationships with our higher level sponsors.
       
       Our Infrastructure report is much more detailed than in recent months.
       This is largely the result of a more collaborative approach to it's
       creation. Furthermore it has been provided in a much more timely
       manner. I'm pleased to see some metrics in the report which help us
       understand the backlog that currently exists. My thanks to the infra
       team for this effort.
       
       No report from TAC at the time of writing. As per last months report TAC
       are expecting to have to ramp up quickly for ApacheCon if it goes ahead
       in April. I will be asking Melissa to use her increased hours to ensure
       the volunteers on that committee are able to cope.
       
       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       FY2012 Taxes were prepared and filed by the Treasurer's Office.
       Next Taxes are due for FY2013 nominally by September 15, 2014. The
       Assistant Treasurer approved remittance for the Treasurer for costs
       incurred for Tax Prep software and for FedEx priority shipping.
       
       An audit list was setup by Jim and Tony and interested folks including
       the Treasurer & Assistant Treasurer, the EA, the President and
       volunteers have subscribed to the list.
       
       A payment was made for the Media Contact DB in coordination with
       VP, Press/Marketing.
       
       PayPal payments are back and working again and that funding stream
       continues again. As a test, the Treasurer initiated a transfer of
       50,000.00 USD to WFS to make sure that transferring money out of
       PayPal works successfully. Will report on the status of this at
       the next board meeting.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       November was a modest month by recent standards. There were 44 iclas,
       two cclas, one nda, and three grants received and filed.

       I'd like to thank sebb for noticing and bringing to the attention of
       PMC chairs that many PMC membership changes have not been properly
       handled with regard to notice to the board and updating
       committee-info.txt.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]


       We have a draft contract for ApacheCon 2014, and would very much
       like to get it signed prior to the Christmas break, so that we
       can start promotion the first of the year. Jim made some comments
       which, I believe, have been addressed in the latest draft. We
       also await the approval of the VP Brand on the trademark portion
       of the contract.

       Directors with comments about the draft contract
       (in $SVN/foundation/ApacheCon/2014) are asked to make those
       comments as soon as possible so that we can expedite the contract
       process.

       A number of people have stepped forward from various PMCs to
       participate in the content review portion of the RFP process, but
       we still have a large number of PMCs that are not represented.
       This will be something that I'll need to address as soon as the
       contract is signed.

       There is a similar issue with ActiveMQ where a console was
       introduced with branding intact that made it appear that the
       console vendor "owned" the project. Shane notes that in
       general, pmcs must clearly separate apache project from
       downstream commercial products. It's fine if people add
       plugins when they use our stuff, or even if they re-ship their
       own product based on our stuff. But when the average user gets
       an Apache product, it should look like an Apache product, and
       not a third party. AI: Chris: will join discussion on

    C. Approve the proposed 2013-2014 Budget (see Attachement BE)

       Tabled.
	  
 8. Discussion Items

    The budget needs to be updated to include estimated trademark registration
    fees.
    
    Roy: Is trademark registration really necessary?
    Shane: In many cases of policing our trademarks, it's a lot easier to get
      potential infringing uses resolved if the trademarks are registered. 
    Roy: We would need to make sure that the names actually are able to be
      registered.
    Shane: Brand awareness is an important part of community development.
    Roy: We can address new registrations without proactively registering all
      of our existing marks. There are a few marks that may be worthwhile but
      not a large number.
    Doug: Registering important marks will save a lot of trouble in the future.
    Roy: Estimates may be low for costs of registration, considering challenges
      brought by commercial interests.
    Shane: The plan is to ask PMCs whether they want their marks registered. If
      there are many objections, we would need to make a decision whether to
      change the name. 
    
    The discussion will continue on the board mail list.


 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Greg: email to multiple PMCs to ask for dates on releases.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Board issue: please see two resolutions for an increased budget for 
Brand Management to meet our needs for our strategy change to use 
registered trademarks in many more situations.

Operations And Community
========================
We had a much busier than usual month for questions and issues raised 
to trademarks@, and a number of issues will take some time to work with 
the relevant PMCs or third parties to fully resolve.

A request to MapR correcting their poor use of the Apache HBase name was 
originally met with a less than acceptable response, but with an 
stronger restatement of our requirements resulted in quick action to 
correct the issues.  A separate and much smaller request from the Apache 
Camel VP to Red Hat was unfortunately met with no substantiative 
response; while escalation to their senior trademark counsel was 
not as well received as I had hoped, I did establish a better 
communication channel for any future branding questions to that company.

Updating Branding Strategy
==========================
In reviewing more complex branding issues with our CouchDB, ActiveMQ, 
Camel, Hadoop, and CloudStack projects (as well as experience from 
past trademark enforcement actions), it has become clear that we 
need to make some changes to our overall branding strategy.  I had a 
call with counsel from DLAPiper to discuss both our project branding 
strategy as well as matters relating to our overall Apache house brand, 
and they confirmed my ideas.  Similarly, a thread on trademarks@ shows 
that the ability to defend our project brands is critical to our 
long term mission.

Therefore, I am proposing that we improve our branding strategy by 
changing to registering most or all of the software product names that 
match our many Apache project names in the US.  This change will 
require a notably expanded Brand Management budget going forward to 
meet our expected annual expenses relating to registering new 
podling/graduating TLP names, as well as a separate, much larger 
short-term budget which will be used to register our many existing 
TLP's names.

I am very cognizant of our duty to take care in the use of the funds 
our many Sponsors (and donors) entrust to us.  However I believe that 
this improvement in branding strategy is critical to ensure that we 
can effectively maintain our strong sense of independent community 
and our long-term ability to continue our mission.  I will also note 
that in a number of conversations with Sponsors I have had that this 
ability to defend our brands is important in their minds as well.

Trademark Registrations
=======================
Counsel have made several registration applications 
in various jurisdictions for our APACHE overall "house brand". These 
registrations are part of a longer term effort to ensure our 
strong ability to defend our Apache brand itself.

Separately, the USPTO issued a registration for our CLOUDSTACK 
product name on the supplemental register, and our efforts to 
secure the registration in Europe are progressing well.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising has been quiet. The EA is working with the VP Fundraising
on day-to-day business. We have had a report of an incoming sizeable
check which we cannot track. We are in communication with the vendor to
locate the payment.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. No vendor payments are due 
at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally 
Khudairi has been working on billing for a Gold-level sponsorship renewal 
for hand-off to the Fundraising team. She is also in discussions with VP 
Fundraising regarding future sponsorship planning.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the 
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this 
timeframe:

  - 19 November: The Apache Software Foundation's Position on Oracle's TCK 
  - 10 December: The ASF asks: have you met Apache™ Marmotta™?
  License

IV. Informal Announcements: 2 items were announced on @TheASF; no new posts 
were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feeds or "TheApacheFoundation" account 
on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: no project-related announcements are currently 
planned. PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as well as podlings 
ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally at 
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' 
notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media requests. The ASF received 
861 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 1,400.

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 14 reports by Gartner, 2 
Forrester Wave reports, 5 write-ups by GigaOM, 12 reports by Yankee Group, 
and 5 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will be working with Rich Bowen and Melissa 
Warnkin on any issues needed for planning the next ApacheCon, with particular 
focus on sponsor-related activities. She continues to field questions from 
possible event partners as well as past delegates regarding the next 
ApacheCon.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: other than award 
nominations detailed in last month's report, there are no formal activities 
taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 9 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ 
GlobeNewswire through December 2013 (Sally will seek an extension to the 
expiration deadline if possible) and 17 pre-paid press releases on the 
PRNewswire account through May 2014. Our donated press release distribution 
by Pressat has no pre-established distribution timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========

* Funded Daniel Gruno's attendance at EU Cloudstack conference: cost TBD.


Board Action Items:
===================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Clear the lengthy backlog of outstanding tlp-related requests.

* Repurpose the new hermes gear for use as a (jenkins?) build master as that is
  more pressing.

* Investigate the migration tooling available for conversion from VMWare to
  Cloudstack [See attachment INFRA-1].

* Look into mac build slaves.

* Migrate eris svn repos to /x2, converting everything to 1.8.

* Converge on git.apache.org migration to eris.

* Investigate / negotiate external code-signing capability, currently in talks
  under NDA. INFRA-3991 is tracking the status, and a Webex call is being arranged.

* Look into rsync backup failures to abi.

* Complete nagios-to-circonus migration for monitoring.

* Continue to experiment with weekly team meetings via google hangout.

* Continue with the effort to reduce the overwhelming JIRA backlog. At the start
  of the reporting period we started with 134 open issues. We are now down to
  ~90 open issues.

* Jan Iversen has been pushing through the outstanding Tlp requests for virtual
  machines.  Several projects should by now have their VM.

* Explore the possibility of revamping the infra documents to have a more 
  intuitive feel about them, improve readability.

* Confluence Upgrade. Needs an intermediate upgrade to 5.0.3 then to latest.
  Attempts have been madse and failed to upgrade to 5.0.3, opened a support case
  but we are cotninuing to try on a test instance.

Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Choose a suitable technology for continued buildout of our virtual
  hosting infra.  Right now we are on VMWare but it no longer is gratis
  software for the ASF.

* Continue gradually replacing gear we no longer have any hardware warranty
  support for.

* Formulate an effective process and surrounding policy documentation for
  fulfilling the DMCA safe harbor provisions as they relate to Apache services.


General Activity:
=================

* Both new tlp's this month, Ambari and Marmotta, were processed within 24
  hours of board approval.


Attachment INFRA-1: Cloudstack Conference Feedback [Daniel Gruno / humbedooh]:
==============================================================================

Attended CCC (Cloudstack Collaboration Conference) at Beurs van Berlage 
in Amsterdam. Tried out Cloudstack locally with a /27 netblock, as well 
as on testing platforms available at the conference. Apart from minute 
errors in the UI (which I have reported), it seems to be working as 
expected. Cloudstack supports LDAP integration, however this is not a 
feature complete integration, and it is my view that an infra-made LDAP
implementation - with regards to _non-infra involvement_ - is preferred, 
though we may elect to use it for the administration of the hosts.

Attended a talk about Apache LibCloud which seamlessly integrates with 
Cloudstack for an easy programmable management of VMs via Python. This 
removes the need for dealing with the rather cumbersome Cloudstack API,
and enables the possibility of creating an infra-managed site for 
dealing with VMS in several ways. Should we ultimately decide on another 
cloud solution, LibCloud integrates with just about every platform out 
there, and so would not be affected by this to any large degree. I did 
not get a chance to properly test LibCloud, so my findings in this regard 
will have to be substantiated at a later date.

Cloudstack offers support for both VMWare (WebSphere), Xen(cloud), KVM,
so migrating is just as much a question of "if" rather than just "when".
It supports using different hypervisors on different pods (a collection of
hosts), so working in tandem with a KVM or similar free hypervisor is an 
option.

Migration options (assuming we go with KVM or similar):

A) Dual hypervisor mode (use both WS and KVM, only allot new VMs on KVM?)
B) Migrate WS boxes to KVM (Qemu-KVM supports this natively with VMWare 
   version 6/7 disks)

if A, then we need to use separate pods for WS and KVM.
if B, then we pull boxes offline, one by one, move the images
      to the new host and KVM can handle the images.

Tentative proposal for future VM management:
Create one or more hosts with KVM in CS(or OS), assign a pod to the old WS 
clients, use Apache LibCloud within an LDAP-authed site (TBD) where PMC 
members can request, restart, get access to, and resize (to be acked by 
infra) instances. Liaison with Tomaz Muraus(LibCloud), Chip 
Childers(Cloudstack) etc on the actual implementation details. This 
would mean that infra's only role would be to ack the creation/resizing 
of VMs and general oversight, rather than manual creation/modification 
of each VM. I expect to have a mockup of what such a site could look like 
ready for infra to review and discuss medio December, thus adding something 
of value to the next board report about it.

Jake Farrell has offered to help with the CS setup, as he has experience 
running this in large environments.

There have been some discussions of maybe using other management platforms 
instead of CloudStack, but given that CloudStack and LibCloud are Apache 
projects, it is my opinion that we are easier suited, support-wise, by 
using software developed by the foundation, as well as the proverbial 
"eating our own dog food".

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

The transition from Sam as VP Legal to myself is progressing smoothly.
Once again, Thanks to Sam for his work in the this role the many years.

There was a spirited but enlightening discussion regarding the suitable
of Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 as a Category A license (as related to
usability with, and capability with, the ALv2). It was agreed that the
discussion had reached the end of its usefullness without further feedback
or guidance by Creative Commons, as to their intents behind the license
and how it relates to commercial redistribution. We are reaching out to
the CC General Counsel for further information; due to her unavailability
while attending a conference/seminar, I don't anticipate an update until
January. FWIW, this issue can be seen as a continuation of, or offshoot of,
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-167.

Mark Thomas proposed a directed question regarding the ability for
ASF PMCs to continue to use, and validate against, expired TCKs. Upon
reading the TCK agreement, Section 10.3 appears to explicitly allow for
such continued use assuming we abide by all other conditions of the
agreement, which does not appear to be an issue. I have asked for our
pro-bono legal counsel to verify and comment.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======

There are no issues that we believe currently require the board's attention.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last releases
were:

* apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
* apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)

Community & Development
=======================

No new committee members have been added this quarter. The last addition to
the committee was on 10th April 2013.

The involvement of Bloodhound with the GSoC and ASF-ICFOSS mentoring schemes
is now complete. The GSoC student who passed the mid term review went on to
complete a successful project. There has not been much further contact from
this student after project completion at this point and so a possible invite
to join the PMC has not yet been considered. Unfortunately, the ASF-ICFOSS
student did not complete the process successfully. As in the case of the
GSoC students, we have left this student with commit access which will allow
the project to be completed if the student desires.

Over the last few months there has been an increase in contributions from
some new developers which may result in new committee members to announce in
the next report.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Camel Project  [Christian Mueller]

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework based on known
Enterprise Integration Patterns.
 
Project Status
--------------
* The project is active and stays at a high level.

* There was a bit of community contention this period when a committer added
a target to Camel's maven plugins to run a third party (but open source)
console with all branding, marketing links, etc... intact and not allowing
the Camel community any control over the display of the Camel portion. The
PMC (in particular 4 PMC members had to issue specific vetos) did decide to
revert this change, but discussion did degrade into various personal attacks,
attacks against employers, etc... This seems to happen very often when there
is a disagreement in Camel and has caused many people to not feel they can
speak up and disagree or state their opinions.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Click Project  [Malcolm Edgar]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Chip Childers]

DESCRIPTION

Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage 
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly 
scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

ISSUES

No issues for the board at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* The community is actively working on both Apache CloudStack 4.3.0 
  (feature release) and Apache CloudStack 4.2.1 (bug fix release).

* The project accepted a donation of a plugin for CloudStack to orchestrate
  networks provided by the OpenContrail software from Juniper Networks.

* A large number of new features, integrations and bug fixes continue to be 
  committed to the repository, so we remain a healthy and growing project.

* The community participated actively in the CloudStack Collaboration Conference 
  EU in Amsterdam in early November. The event was quite successful, both in terms
  of drawing in new members to our community, as well as providing an opportunity
  for the Apache CloudStack community to work with a number of other projects
  (notably Apache Libcloud and Gluster). Close to 400 people attended the event.

* We have broken out our CLI tool, CloudMonkey, from the main CloudStack git 
  repository, and we have made our first release of that software in September.

* We have broken the product documentation out from the main source code repository,
  with the specific intent of being able to have the documentation release / 
  publishing process be faster and easier than the code itself.  There is also
  a proposal being discussed to change from the publican docbook format to .rst
  format in the hope that this will lower the barriers for user contributions.

RELEASES
* Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey 5.0.0 was released on September 24, 2013
* Apache CloudStack 4.2.0 was released on October 1, 2013.

COMMUNITY

Including the following additions, CloudStack has 83 committers and 24 PMC members.

New Committers:

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary Gregory]

The Commons is an Apache project focused on all aspects of reusable Java 
components. Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both 
within Apache and without.

There are no issues that require board attention at this time.

Overall project health is good with six releases this period, including the 
long anticipated [pool] 2.0 and [collections] 4.0.

Releases:

    Apache Commons JCI 1.1 on 2013-10-14
    Apache Commons Email 1.3.2 on 2013-10-23
    Apache Commons Compress 1.6 on 2013-10-26
    Apache Commons Configuration 1.10 2013-10-27
    Apache Commons Pool 2.0 on 2013-11-11
    Apache Commons Collections 4.0 on 2013-11-24

The [csv] component is still inching towards 1.0 releases and [imaging] is 
very close to 1.0 as well. Expected soon are [lang] 3.2 and [beanutils] 1.9.

The mailing list and JIRA activity is good, most support issues get timely 
replies, and development discussions are positive. One of the recurring topics
is migration from Subversion to Git, the current plan is to try this with one 
component, [cli]. Another discussion is how to reflect component liveliness 
into the site and what to do with mostly inactive components. To this end, the
main page lists the version and latest release date for each component. 
Another recurring theme is when and how to update the dated look and feel of 
the site; the current thinking here is to use the Fluido skin. A perennial 
concern is how to attract new developers, one proposal is to better integrate
our processes with git and GitHub.

On the branding side, active components have been updated to use “Apache
Common <Component>” and a “TM” in their logos. This leaves us with dealing
with the other components with little or no activity, which do not follow 
these rules yet. Another issue with inactive components is that their Oracle 
Javadoc HTML pages suffer from a frame injection vulnerability (see 
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/225657 and 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujun2013-1899847.html); 
here we are considering patching the sites using an Oracle tool.

We are discussing using StackOverflow open source advertisements and are 
currently unsure whether which logo we can use, Apache, Apache Commons, or a 
new logo.

The following new committers have joined us:

    Ate Douma (ate) on 2013-10-14
    Woonsan Ko (woonsan) on 2013-10-14

ASF Member Henning Schmiedehausen (henning) rejoined the PMC 2013-10-31. 
There are no other new PMC members.

The IRC channel #apache-commons has been set up on freenode, with 
currently low activity.

The PMC changed its chair from Luc Maisonobe to Gary Gregory. The 
Apache Commons community is grateful for Luc’s service.

Mailing list stats:

    dev@commons.apache.org: 1924 messages.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brent Atkinson]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

There has been heightened activity since the last cycle, much of which has been
related to migrating the project to recent versions of Apache Struts. This is 
primarily to address a remote execution vulnerability that resulted in vmbuild
being compromised and subsequently disabled by the infrastructure team. 

The last release was Continuum 1.4.1, on January 7, 2013. A release to address
the mentioned vulnerabilities is pending, but still being worked towards.

There has been volume on the mailing lists and in the issue tracker, but still
relatively low.

There have been no new committers since last cycle. The last committer was 
added December 8, 2010 and the last PMC member was added on September 2, 2012.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex SDK 4.11.0 was released on 10/28/13.
Apache Flex Installer 2.7.0 was also released on 10/28/13.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex continues to be in two main areas:  improvements
To the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent code base, including the
releases listed above, and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex
that is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  There is another group
working on Maven-related tools for the existing code base.

In the past three months we've seen:
- Continued JIRA activity (more bugs raised than resolved however)
- More folks contributing and eventually becoming committers.

Other highlights:
-Over 60 bugs were fixed in 4.11.0.
-We adopted a set of guidelines/by-laws.  They are on our wiki at:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Guidelines

Code Donation Update
-FlexUnit was donated but has yet to be formulated into a release.
-Swiz donation is still pending.  The donator has not filed the paperwork.
-BlazeDS donation paperwork was submitted but the code is not yet in the
repo because it was discovered that some pieces were missing.  We hope to 
get the missing pieces before the next report, maybe even by end of year.

COMMUNITY
-Stephan Plath added as committer on 11/17/13.
-Cosma Colanicchia added as committer on 10/17/13.
-Tom Chiverton added as a committer on 9/30/13.
-Maurice Amsellem added as a committer on 9/28/13.
-Darrell Loverin added as a committer on 9/13/13.
-Maurice Amsellem promoted from committer to PMC on 11/9/13.
-Latest analytics include over 3000 hits per day on the website during the
work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 3000 installs of 4.11.0 in
the month since its release.

AREAS OF CONCERN (FROM LAST REPORT)
-RELEASE EFFORT: In the last report we reported that "getting a release
out seems more difficult than it should be because folks don't start
serious testing on the first RCs so important bugs are found just before
the VOTE ends and another RC has to be made."
For the 4.11 release, we adopted "carry-over" voting based on a
suggestion from a board member.  If there were minor changes to the
release artifacts, you could carry over your vote from the prior
release candidate.  That, and I think just having more
experience in cutting releases made the 4.11 release go much more smoothly.
-NUMBER OF ACTIVE COMMITTERS: In the last report we reported that "even
though 200 bugs were fixed in 4.10.0, the majority were done by one
committer."  Over the past 3 months, six new people made contributions and
were voted in as committers.

TRADEMARKS
-It was discovered that an external entity was using http://apacheflex.com
to redirect to their web site.  They were notified and have changed the
redirect to the Apache Flex website.  They have offered to have Apache
take over the domain http://apacheflex.com.  We need to figure out
how to do this.
-It looks like the new version of Flex is going to be called FlexJS.  We
need to find out if we need to trademark that name.  We will be contacting
trademarks@ shortly.


INFRASTRUCTURE
* I'm still hoping to find time to resolve INFRA-4380 (attachments in old
Flex bugs).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Very little activity, Gump seems to create useful results for the few
projects that use it.  A team at Oracle seems to be running Gump for
compatibility tests of Java 8.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuosly" philosophy.

Stefan has polled the Gump list and our only known user outside of the
ASF whether anybody would like to see a release but no response was
received.

== Activity ==

Ludmila Shikhvarg who works at Oracle and tests next-Java
compatibility runs Gump internally at Oracle.  Unfortunately the
instance is not a public one.  Occasionally she pings the Gump list to
tells us about build problems she sees, she did so for three projects
and Java8 in October and traffic has been directed to the project
mailing lists.

The Gump installation on vmgump was stuck for several weeks and nobody
noticed it.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.  The most
recent addition to the PMC was in December 2006 when we added Sander
Temme.

    data store. It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying and
    managing HBase tables using SQL.

  * Twill is an abstraction over Apache Hadoop YARN that reduces the
    complexity of developing distributed applications, allowing developers
    to focus more on their business logic

  * Log4cxx -- Logging for C++.  This new podling is a reboot of an existing
    Apache project with a fresh group of contributors.

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

    Helix

* Retirements

  * The Provisionr podling voted to retire and then followed through on
    completing the retirement guide (a rarity).  Best wishes to the
    wonderful, wonderful Provisionr people in their future endeavors.

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Nov 11 Apache Allura (incubating) 1.0.1

    Apache Tez 0.2.0-incubating           Nov 26      Nov 26         0

* IP Clearance

  * Citrix has donated a plugin for Apache CloudStack to support RDP
    connectivity for virtual machines running within Hyper-V hypervisors.

  * IBM has donated Distributed UIMA Cluster Computing (DUCC), a cluster
    management system providing tooling, management, and scheduling
    facilities to automate the scale-out of applications using the UIMA
    framework.

  * Adobe has donated the Sling replication module, which allows resources
    to be replicated between Sling instances.

* Infrastructure

  * The Incubator dist area is now fully transitioned to dist.apache.org.
    Infra is pleased.

* Miscellaneous

  * The Incubator experienced a rough cycle for releases.  Several podlings
    experienced long wait times for IPMC votes.  One release made it out
    despite IP clearance not having been completed.  Another was improperly
    released with only two IPMC +1 votes.

  * The initiative to reform release voting continues.  We achieved consensus
    for one particular approach and tried it. The approach seems not to have
    succeeded (though some argue it has not been given enough time).  We are
    now negotiating a second approach.  We have not yet achieved a
    breakthrough, but progress is being made and discussions are civil and
    proceeding at a measured pace rather than overheating as past efforts
    have.

  * We've started recruiting non-IPMC shepherds and the new volunteers have
    brought substantial energy and enthusiasm to the task.

  * The Chair finished coding up several new tools around reporting which will
    hopefully make it easier to sustain high report quality into the future.
    An attempt to recruit a "Report Manager" for this cycle did not yield any
    volunteers, though.

Allura

Forge software for the development of software projects, including source
control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other software
project management tools.

Allura has been incubating since 2012-06-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to grow community
  2. Make another release
  3. Move project development to ASF hardware

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  It was difficult to get responses from IPMC and our mentors, for our first
  release.  It finally did get the needed responses and votes, and the IPMC
  has been discussing general improvements in this area, which is good.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several new folks on the mailing list have been asking questions about
  setup and configuration of Allura.  A few contributions by Rui Ferreira
  have been submitted through the tracker but not merged yet.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Our legal/notice files were finalized and we made our first release.  Many
  fixes & features have been added, primarily regarding importing projects
  from other sites into Allura.

Date of last release:

  2013-11-11

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  2013-04-11

Signed-off-by:

  [ ](allura) Ross Gardler

--------------------
Aurora

Aurora is a service scheduler used to schedule jobs onto Apache Mesos.

Aurora has been incubating since 2013-10-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. First release.
  2. Establish a consistent development process and release rhythm.
  3. Expanding the community and adding new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Finish bootstrapping project, IP clearance, initial website.
  - Announcement and live demo at first #MesosTownhall.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Code has been approved and migrated to Apache, complete with (scrubbed)
    commit history.
  - Development work has continued inside of Twitter, but will now begin
    moving to the open.

Date of last release:

  - No releases as of yet. Targeting first release for mid-January.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  - No new committers; still stabilizing code and preparing for first
    release.

Shepherd notes:

  Jake Farrell (jfarrell):

    For Aurora everything is progressing nicely.  All initial setup and on
    boarding is completed and development has started using ASF
    infrastructure (jira/reviewboard/etc).  No blockers or issues at this
    time.

--------------------
BatchEE

FIXME

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Shepherd notes:

  Marvin Humphrey (marvin):

    Podling did not report.  Please report next month.
    
    Also, please edit podlings.xml metadata and address all "FIXME" tags.

--------------------
Apache: Project Drill

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale
datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to efficiently process
nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to be able to process
petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:

  1. Continue to attract new developers and and early users with a variety of
     skills and viewpoints
  2. Continue to develop deeper community skills and knowledge by building
     additional releases
  3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
     multiple project members.

  The community has made significant progress on items 1 and 2.

Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

  none

How community has developed since last report:

  Community awareness and participation were strengthened through a meeting
  of the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group with over 100 participants locally
  in San Jose and remotely via Cisco-hosted Webex. On site speakers included
  3 Drill contributors, two from San Jose and one from Seattle
  http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Apache-Drill-User-Group/

  Additional events include:

    * Code for 1st milestone release was posted and made available via
      project website; release was socialized via mailing list, Twitter,
      blogs and presentations
    * Several new full-time developers joined the project
    * Apache Drill received a Bossie award "Best open source big data tools"
      17 September 2013 http://s.apache.org/B3H (infoworld.com)

  Mailing list discussions:

    Subscriptions to the Drill mailing lists have risen to 415. There has
    been active and increasing participation in discussions on the developer
    mailing list, including new participants and developers. Participation
    on the user list is growing although still small; mainly activity takes
    place on developer mailing list.

    Code commits (during the period 01/09/2013 - 06/012/2013) include but
    not limited to following:

    * Spooling batch buffer
    * Fix over memory pre-allocation within ParquetRecordReader.
    * Implement simple metrics framework
    * prepare release drill-1.0.0-m1.
    * Implement builders for Scan, Sort, LogicalPlan and PlanProp.

  Community Interactions

    The weekly Drill hangout continues, conducted remotely through Google
    hangouts Tuesday mornings 9am Pacific Time to keep core developers in
    contact in realtime despite geographical separation. A Gdoc is being
    updated regarding the discussions during hangout.
    http://s.apache.org/4Gc (docs.google.com)

    The community stays in touch through @ApacheDrill Twitter ID, and by
    postings on various blogs including Apache Drill User
    http://drill-user.org/ which has had several updates and through
    international presentations at conferences.

    Viability of the community is also apparent as participants in the open
    source Apache Drill community came together on November 4th meet-up of
    the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group, with 391 members enrolled. The
    group looked at how Drill works now and what will be the next steps in
    the project. The event marked the recent first official release of the
    Apache Drill project.

Shepherd notes:

  Matt Franklin (mfranklin):
    
    I have reviewed the community and have concluded that it is very active and 
    healthy.  IMO, #3 in the issues to address before graduation is not critical
    and can be successfully mitigated by documenting the tasks that are currently 
    being executed by single individuals.  My recommendation is that the Drill 
    podling begin the graduation process after completion of the next release. 

  Marvin Humphrey (marvin):

    The report is admirably thorough and must have taken a long time to
    prepare.  Perhaps consider that a report with a reduced level of detail
    similar to the other reports may be more in line with Board
    expectations.

    The report was filed too late to be incorporated into a review by the
    assigned shepherd.  Please file on time.

    Please wrap future reports at 77 columns, and please take more care with
    making indentation reflect logical hierarchy.  Also, use only
    s.apache.org URL shorteners in future reports.  Otherwise, someone
    downstream must clean up the report -- either someone from the IPMC (I
    took care of reformatting this month) or the Board -- before it is
    published in the official Board minutes.

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Prepare Kalumet 0.7.0-incubating release
  2. Publish the documentation of the website
  3. Refactore some modules

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of activity during the last two
  months.

  We count on the first release to gather more people on the project
  (contributors and users).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We released Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating release on November, 22, 2013.

Shepherd notes:

  John Ament (johndament):

    Kalumet seems to be OK, but a little bit slow.  They have been
    incubating for a little over 2 years now, I think if they can get
    together on another release shortly they should consider graduating,
    there was some confusion for a little while over IPMC vs PPMC votes
    which caused a delay in getting their 0.6 release out the door.

--------------------
MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, and Spark.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. recruit more users, developers, committers and PMCers
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Shepherd notes:

  Dave Fisher (wave):
  
    This podling achieved one benchmark towards successful incubation - a
    release.

    When commits and mailing list activity are reviewed this looks like a
    tiny community with only a single developer and some administrative
    support.

    I am not sure if this another example of a community that is mostly from
    a single corporation and is doing all of the work outside and
    contributing it through one person with off-list decision making and
    communication. If so then the mentors need to look into it and get the
    real decision making process in public.

    There is a user ML, but the only email ever on that list was the release
    announcement.

--------------------
NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

The podling continues to have a low amount of activity. However, there are
still committers involved that wish to see it succeed. A recent prod from
the Incubator PMC has reignited some interest, including from new
contributors and existing users of the project.

Unfortunately, we have gradually lost mentors, and the last one resigned in
November. Thankfully, Raphael Bircher has volunteered to step in. There are
ASF members on the project, however we could still use other independent
mentors willing to keep an eye on the project and keep prodding.

In the current state, we might find it difficult to get enough votes
together for a release.

We have requested that JIRA notifications be sent to the dev@ list instead
of commits@, so we can keep as much discussion in one place as possible.

With the recent activity, we have started to identify a list of things that
need to be done to get activity moving again, and the next release out. This
needs to be fleshed out, including details of who is willing to contribute
to them.

The last release was made on 16 May 2011.

Shepherd notes:

  Justin Mclean (jmclean):

    Last report was July 2013. At noted in the current report there are some
    issues to overcome for the project to move forward.

    In the last month there been some increased activity on the mailing
    lists (thanks to the last shepherd) but as yet no fixes or patches have
    been submitted. The project currently has only one mentor (just
    appointed) and the PPMC seems to have gone missing.

--------------------
Ripple

Ripple is a browser based mobile platform development and testing tool.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Fix licensing issues, specifically some of the images.
  2. Build up the community.
  3. Make a release under Apache.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are still seeing increased non-committer participation in
  threads, issues, etc.

  However, aside from the odd contribution, most of the recent work
  has been committer based.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Intel has been doing a lot of work on the project (in a fork)- still
  waiting for a possible contribution back into the ASF project.
  http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools

  Continuing Cordova 3.0 work to get to a stable, releasable product.

  The Chrome Extension build target was removed altogether from the project,
  in an effort to simplify and streamline the building/compilation of the
  project into a usable application, and because the project has been
  continually moving towards a [more feature-able] NodeJS backend, capable
  of being run in any Browser.

scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. No development since last release
  2. Limited activity on mailing lists
  3. Need new committers/contributors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  There was a discussion related to retirement but there was some interest
  from the community to continue the project. However there were no
  contributions since last release.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No activity on dev mailing list over last couple of months

How has the project developed since the last report?

  No major commits since last release. One of the reason

  John Ament (johndament):

    The board report reflects my sentiments as well.  S4 seems to be in a
    bit of rut.  I tried kicking off some conversations on the dev mailing
    list, no luck.  It seems like there are at best five active
    participants, between the users list and dev list.  Considering that
    there hasn't been a commit since last board report, it doesn't come off
    as a good sign for me.  I think retirement may be an option to start
    exploring.

--------------------
Sentry

Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build community and add new committers
  2. Continue to release at regular intervals

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community development continues. Sentry held its first key signing meetup
  for committers. A number of committers participated.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A number of new JIRAs have been filed and are being actively worked on.
  Support for Solr index level authorization is complete and available on

Storm has been incubating since 2013-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Licensing and IP clearance.
  2. First Apache release.
  3. Growing the community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Storm has a number of dependencies that are forked/modified versions
  of other projects (including Apache Thrift). We have started a discussion
  on the dev mailing list regarding the best way to resolve these issues.
  As we have yet to do our first Apache release, we will be looking for
  additional guidance from our mentors in reaching that goal.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  We continue to see interest/involvement from contributors in the
  form of github pull requests.


How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have released Storm 0.9.0 from the non-Apache github process.
  This will be the last non-Apache release. Our next focus will
  be to work on our first Apache release and migrating to the Apache
  Way.

    Storm has started three months ago. It is quite active and looks ok,
    so far. They created a last release outside Apache and they work now
    at the IP. I noticed that http://incubator.apache.org/storm/ still
    not exist. If you search at Google for storm, you only find the
    GitHub page. I find a minimal site on the Apache server important.
    so people can easely find ML and co.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Uwe Schindler]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.


TLP
---

No new PMC members were added in the last quarter.  The most recent PMC
member addition happened in April 2013.

We added two new committers in the last quarter: Joel Bernstein, Ryan Ernst.
Wolfgang Hoschek rejoined the committer team after longer abstinence, leaving
the emeritus status.


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made three releases of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.5.0 on 5 October 2013
 - 4.5.1 on 24 October 2013
 - 4.6.0 on 24 November 2013

The corresponding Apache Solr Reference Guides were released
as PDF versions, generated from the Confluence Wiki:

 - 4.5 on 5 October 2013
 - 4.6 on 2 December 2013

The community is very active.

The Lucene PMC was contacted by the Oracle Quality Assurance team to help
with testing EA builds of OpenJDK 8 with Lucene/Solr. Three members of the
PMC had phone conferences with Oracle's QA team, discussing about working
together in discovering bugs before releasing Java 8, to prevent serious data
corruption issues, like happened with Java 7GA in July 2011 and Java 7u40
in September 2013.

Security: There were 3 CVEs created by the Redhat security team
against version 3.6.2 of Apache Solr:

 - CVE-2013-6397
 - CVE-2013-6407
 - CVE-2013-6408

Those issues were only fixed and released in Solr 4.1 and 4.6, because no new
3.x release was planned (EOL of 3.x). The committers helped to backport the
fixes (see SOLR-5520). The PMC has not yet decided if there will be a
maintenance release of Apache Lucene/Solr 3.6.3 containing these fixes.


Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene and others
tools for judging the quality of search and machine learning approaches.  The
community is not very active, but we don't expect it to be very high volume
either as it is a niche area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

In the last quarter we made one release of PyLucene:

 - 4.5.1-1 on 5 November 2013


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.
 
== Summary ==
 
Activity has really picked up on our .NET port of Lucene 4.3. We've
officially brought in our apache repo work that started the 4.3 port from our
community. Work is still underway to finalize the port, some clean up work,
some additional features, and testing are all underway.
 
It's not clear when we will be releasing 4.3, but I think our hope is
January.
 
== Statistics ==
 
Nuget package downloads:
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 39549
Lucene.Net Contrib 3.0.3: 12674
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 1715
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 521


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

An Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta has graduated from the Incubator in November 2013,
this is the first report as a TLP to the Board. The transition was
completed within less than a week and development is converging to the
first release as a TLP.

Engagement on the mailing lists is good, the dev-list is on a stable
high volume (around 200/month) and the user-list shows growing
engagement and interest in the last quarter.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
dev@marmotta.a.o: 56 subscribers
user@marmotta.a.o: 55 subscribers

Branding
  For the transition from Incubator to a TLP, we have (temporarily)
  modified project logo [1]. This version will probably be used until
  the end of this year, then we'll switch back to the original.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.0.0, released on
  May 21, 2013. This was MRUnit's first release since graduation in May 2012.


CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/3rd
* 2 JIRA's was resolved since the last report.
* Work continues on a major feature in MRUNIT-13.
* A release will likely occur after MRUNIT-13 is committed.
* Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since Oct 1st: dev 37, user 13

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 36 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 73 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 10 committers
  - Total of 10 PMC members

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Releases*
* no new releases have been issued since July 2013 (they have been included
  in the previous report to the ASF Board)
* the stabilization of the latest release branch 13.07 is proceeding
  smoothly; the goal is to issue the first release out of it (13.07.01) in
  February 2014
* we are also backporting bug fixes to the older but still active release
  branches 12.04 and 11.04: within the first quarter of 2014 we will
  probably issue one release for each of them

*Community and Project*
* no new committers or PMC members have been added in this quarter; the
  last committer was Paul Foxworthy (paulfoxworthy), invited in
  November 2012; the last PMC member was Erwan de Ferrieres (erwan),
  invited in December 2009
* mailing list traffic is lower than in the past years but it is still
  relevant and there is good community interaction
* significant work done in the trunk mainly in the following areas:
** bug fixes, improvements and optimizations (thread safety, high load…)
** maintenance: code upgrade to support most recent versions of external
   jars (e.g. Tomcat, FOP, Groovy, POI, Lucene…)
** code cleanups and improved modularity
** enhancements and new features (General Ledger, Payments, Minilang,
   Security, URL generation...)

*Infra/Legal*
We have no issues.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Sean Kelly]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

• OODT-0.6 on 2013-07-17
• OODT-0.5 on 2012-12-25

OODT-0.7 will focus on Apache Tika [1] integration and Apache CXF [2]
integration.  We resolved 8 issues in JIRA [3] since our last report.

We reported a security vulnerability [4] to the Apache Security Team.  The fix
will be included in OODT-0.7.  There have been zero reports of exploits of this
vulnerability.  We also feel this particular part of the code is not in use
by anyone anymore.  We may excise the code altogether in a future release.

Our development mailing lists remain popular, while the user list shows less
activity.  The table below lists the number of postings by list, by month, in
2013:

List Oct Nov Dec
---- --- --- ---
dev   55  70   3

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status

We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality
are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

Most of the work being done at the moment, is aimed at doing maintenance
releases to keep up with the Apache Camel, CXF, Karaf, ... releases and doing
bundles releases of updated dependencies.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community

No changes since last report.  The last addition to the PMC dates back
to September 2009.  The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives

Since our last board report, we have finished the 4.5.3 release and we
are continuing to work on our 4.6.0 and 5.0.0 release.

Releases

- A set of 39 OSGi bundles in October
- Apache ServiceMix 4.5.3 in October
- A set of 31 OSGi bundles in November
- A set of 16 OSGi bundles in December


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- No new releases since our May 30 2013 1.2.2 bugfix release.  A 1.3 release
  is still on the horizon as an interim before 2.0.

Community & Project:

- Brian Demers accepted his nomination to the Shiro PMC.  We're happy to have
  him aboard!

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution are slow going, as the last quarter has
  been particularly busy for the entire Shiro team.  The community is
  advocating a few issues that probably should be represented in a 1.3
  interim release, so they don't have to wait for 2.0 (JSF release + bug
  fixes).

- User mailing list has been quite active the last month.  We're grateful for
  a community that helps each other out a lot without as much guidance by the
  core shiro team as might have been necessary earlier in the project's
  history.

Last PMC Member voted in: Brian Demers on 20 May 2013

stands, one of them has already accepted the invitation and filed 
an ICLA. 

The last Synapse committer before our most recent vote was elected 
on March, 2012. Last Synapse PMC member was elected on January, 2012.

The level of participation is consistent and healthy. The existing 
committers are actively contributing to the project. 

During the reporting period there have been 14 commits from 2 
committers.

Both user and developer mailing lists continue to be active with a 
moderate amount of traffic.

Releases:

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012. Work is currently underway for a 3.0 release.

None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a templating framework for modern Java applications. Based upon 
the Composite pattern it is built to simplify the development of user interfaces.

This quarter has shown a dramatic spike in activity on the Tiles User mailing list.
That activity has spurred us to release the first GA release of version 3 of the
framework. Most of the mailing list activity consisted of users asking questions 
and seeking advice. The PMC was active in answering these questions, but several
community members have assisted others in doing the same. It is my hope that 
some of this activity may lead to new committers joining the project.

Releases:

The Tiles PMC had our first GA release of the 3.x branch of the framework this 
quarter. Apache Tiles 3.0.3 was released with a quality stamp of GA in November.

Community:

There have been no changes to the Tiles community in this quarter.
The last addition to the PMC was in April, 2012.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Wicket 6.11.0 and 6.12.0
- Wicket now has a user guide available on our website
- Wicket is almost 10 years old, somewhere early in 2014 is our 
  anniversary
- Wicket 7 release discussion should be started

Date last committer added: 12 July 2013

Discussions on dev@ list for several subjects are lively. Interest in
the project is still strong, even after all these years. Users@ is also
still very active, with most questions answered quickly.

New user guide

The user guide discussed in previous reports is now live and available
from our website (http://wicket.apache.org/start/userguide.html). We
should announce it more prominently.

Pull requests

Most pull requests that arrive at our mailing list are rather trivial
changes to documentation, configurations and setups, and the requests
make our offering better so they are welcomed.

Release building

At the time of writing the release for Wicket 6.13.0 is delayed due to
migrating to a new laptop and a test that fails under a specific JDK
version. We expect this release to be final before the next report and
that we have 6.14 and possibly 6.15 also on the list of releases.

Wicket 7 release

The Wicket 7 release has been hanging in limbo for a while. A major
version in semver release schedule can contain API breaks and Wicket 7
currently has few of them. We should start a discussion about when we
think that Wicket 7 is considered done.

runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed applications.
 
Trunk is still under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. A couple
of important improvements on the way for 3.5.0:
 
- One important new feature in 3.5.0 will be the ability to reconfigure
a ZooKeeper ensemble. This feature was discussed a long time in
ZOOKEEPER-107 and we have converged and committed it;
- We are also focusing on a number of improvements over the code that
performs recovery. In particular, we are targeting an implementation that
avoids sending and taking unnecessary snapshots, which reduces time to
recover in the presence of crashes.
 
Also, release is supposed to address scalability, jdk7 and openjdk support,
maven build/rel, testing and audit logging. There are other various patches
we are working on related code cleanup and refactoring.
 
Note that the status of releases hasn't changed since the last board report.
3.5.0 release date is not defined yet. 
 
A bug fix release 3.4.6 is also expected to go out soon. There are two jiras
currently blocking the release.
 
The last release has been 3.4.5 on November 18, 2012.
 
No infrastructure issues.
 
Community:
 
Mailing list activity is moderate and the number of patch reviews and
commits has dropped significantly. 
 
* 10 active committers representing 8 unique organizations. No change to
the list of committers.
*  9 active PMC members representing 7 unique organizations. No change to
the list of committers.
* 408 subscribers on dev (hasn't changed in the last quarter).

2013)
 
=== BookKeeper (subproject)
 
Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging service.
The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable Pub/Sub service
built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong durability guarantees.
 
We released Bookkeeper 4.2.2 on the 10th October 2013. This was a bugfix
release, but also exposed some new administrative functions for dealing with
ledgers.
 
We continue to work towards 4.3.0. The final scope of the release has been
decided on. It will include improved bookie on-disk performance, a new
statistics collection framework and SSL support, among other things. We
hope to release 4.3.0 in Q1 of 2014.
 
Infrastructure issues:
No issues.
