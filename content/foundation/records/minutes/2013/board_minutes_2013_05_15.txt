 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       Our annual members meeting is next week.  Nominations have now
       closed.  We have a strong slate of nominees for both membership
       and next year's board.

       Today is the final meeting of the current board.  Thanks to
       those who served this past year.  You effectively guided Apache
       on its mission.  Thanks also for having me as your chair.  It's
       been an honor.

    B. President [Jim]

       A relatively normal month since the last meeting. No problems or
       problematic issues require board attention.

       The first item of note is the (re)proposed 2013-2014 budget. The
       revised budget contains the following changes from the previous
       proposal:

        a. President's discretionary fund returned to $5k.
        b. Updated Infra budget for increased staffing

       Special Order 7C calls for formal approval of the budget.

       As requested, our EA is now submitting monthly reports for inclusion
       in the board agenda/minutes. Feedback and comments are welcomed. As
       will be noted below, I expect that the workflow associated with the
       EA to increase to do ApacheCon conf procedural changes and an
       increased workload, as reflected in the budget.

       Trademarks, Fundraising and M&P are all progressing well. Infra
       reported extremely late but, except for the lateness of the report,
       there are no issues to concern the board. As of the date of this
       writing, I did not receive anything from TAC or Concom; Concom
       is an item of discussion however, so having no report isn't that
       much of a concern at this point. TAC seems simply in idle-mode.

       As noted in the EVP report, Concom is restructuring, based on a
       better and more realistic review of available resources and capa-
       bilities. Both the EVP and I feel that this will be the "secret
       sauce" and solution looked for by the board.

       Sam, Chris, Hadrian and I had discussions regarding the status
       and movement of the audit effort. The general consensus was that
       Chris would be working with Hadrian to get our books into
       "acceptable" shape enough to allow us to, in the very near term,
       get an accountant to review our books and methods and give us
       a good, solid "gut-check" on where we are, regarding our finances.

       On a personal matter, I will be unable to attend the 1st half of
       next week's member's meeting. I can still setup and "run" the
       elections if required/desired; I'll need to know ASAP however,
       to ensure that I do the prep-work to allow anyone to "kick-off"
       the polls, if I am late in returning from the hospital.
       
       Finally, I wish to thank all Directors and members for the
       opportunity to have served as Director again; it's been an honor
       and privilege.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 0 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
       For the first time in my tenure as Treasurer (and I think in ASF
       history), we are now managing over $1M in finances for the foundation.

       A check was cut to deal with final lagging ACNA 2013 charges for
       one of our TAC travelers.

       Discussion around the audit was picked up again, with Jim calling
       for an audit to occur and consensus being reached with Chris, and
       Sam.  Chris sent a summary email detailing the 4 outcomes of the
       discussion, namely:

       1. An audit will be pushed forward - Hadrian to lead 
       2. Chris is concerned about the additional time that this will
          add to his plate. Just a concern, but wants it noted. 
          Sam suggested that rather than hiring a CPA to do this, we 
          should be leveraging the EA.
       3. The audit is assumed be a multi-month process. 
       4. Chris will proceed with helping with the audit, and continuing
          treasurer role. One concrete outcome from this is a desire by Chris
          to document the treasurer process.  INFRA-6262 created for this.

       Ulrich Stärk raised the issue of an EU subsidiary to the Treasurer's
       Office and to Upayavira from a sponsorship perspective. The idea
       is that EU sponsors would find it easier to deal with us if we had
       such a subsidiary. Additionally, ASF members dealing with the
       Treasurer's Office for reimbursements, and payments, etc., would
       also benefit from this.  Though the idea seems like a good one,  
       from the Treasurer's perspective I suggested that it won't matter
       much to me -- most EU folks I reimburse or send $$$ accept wires,
       and the only pain point is the charges their banks sometimes charge.
       But otherwise it's just as easy on my end to wire money or send
       checks (bill pay) regardless. However, I did suggest to Uli to raise
       the issue to the board if desired, and that the Treasurer's Office
       would work to support whatever is decided. Largely though it's not
       the Treasurer's role to do anything other than to implement the
       policy not to define it (IMO).

       Chris and Sam have both stepped up efforts to get WFS statements
       in SVN faster than normal since Upayavira would like to track
       sponsorship donations in a more streamlined fashion.
 
       The EA's FY 2012 1099 copy was delivered and received at her
       residence.  Sorry for the delay. Speaking of Taxes, our FY 2012
       taxes can be started since our books for FY 2012 are now closed
       (end of April). I believe we have until 9/15 to deliver them without
       late fee. So, plenty of time!

       Sam and Chris have reached out to WFS and our financial consultant
       Paschal to deal with Bill Pay issues.

       Doug noted that Treasurers generally are not immediately reappointed
       upon a board election.  Ross asks if we have concrete examples of Uli's
       concern of potential sponsors. Chris said no, and felt that it was a
       lot of work. Ross agreed that without concrete examples we shouldn't 
       pursue it.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of secretary is running smoothly. In April,
       53 iclas, two cclas, one grant, and two ndas were received
       and filed.

       Thanks to Sam for filling in for this board meeting.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       I made all officers and PMCs of the plans to restructure ConCom
       to reflect the available resources and capabilities (See
       special order D). This will see the responsibilities of
       Conference Planning move to the President, Brand Management,
       Marketing and Publicity, and Community Development Project. Two
       points of concern were raised. The first by VP Community
       Development. This concern was that the small Community
       Development Project might not be able to cope with the new
       responsibilities, especially given that other PMCs are
       considering asking ComDev to assist them. See the ComDev board
       report for more information. The second concern was raised by
       VP Marketing and Publicity who felt there was the potential
       for new roles and responsibilities not to be clear and thus
       important responsibilities might go unaddressed. This is
       something that we must remain aware.

       In my opinion neither of these concerns should prevent us
       moving forward with the proposed change.

       I contacted The Open Bastion on behalf of the President in
       order to evaluate their interest in producing an ApacheCon
       North America and Europe. They are working on a new contract
       for our consideration and have asked me to build a list of
       conferences that should be avoided. Our EA will begin handling
       the contract negotiations going forward and will work with the
       President as appropriate.

       Greg notes that responsibilities falling through the cracks is
       what we are trying to address with this change. Ross continues
       to acknowledge the concern. Doug is concerned about handing a
       volunteer committee responsibilities that they are not
       enthusiastically accepting. Greg points out that people who
       are interested in small events are the volunteers and they
       will simply show up a that new list. Ross agrees and indicates
       that comdev will be less of a 'gatekeeper' than concom was.

       Management Committees, which will be effective 72 hours
       after a Director of the Board acknowledges receipt of a
       notification from the Vice President to the Board specifying
       the change in membership of the committee,
       unless a Director of the Board disagrees with the change within those
       72 hours, and

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that each such Vice President may
       delegate this authority and responsibility to appoint the membership

       Directors via electronic mail, citing the archived record of the 
       decision in the Foundation's email archive, and such notification 
       shall serve as equivalent to the notification from the Vice President 
       as described hereinabove.  And

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Vice President for Infrastructure 
       shall establish an appropriate policy permitting the grant of the

 8. Discussion Items

    Greg to send out a general note to cover missing information (such as
    dates of last release and dates of last change to PMC composition) in
    reports.
    
    Hadrian asked for a clarification on what information needs to be
    generated or produced for an audit.  The board directed Hadrian to work
    with Chris and Jim, and suggested that we make available whatever records
    we have to the auditor that he selects.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items
        * Daniel: Draft an ASF policy for projects which need to re-bundle
          other Apache projects.
              Status: projects have come to an informal consensus,
              closing this item.
    
        * Doug: follow up with XMLBeans PMC to see if project is still viable.
              Status: Not done.
    
        * Greg: Contact Cassandra PMC to ask for dates on releases.
              Status: Not done, will roll into larger (multiple project) email.
    
        * Greg: Let Flume PMC know that affiliations are not needed in the
          board report.
              Status: Bertrand to take over this item, for Flume and Oozie.
    
        * Jim: Contact Oozie PMC with comments about affiliations and JIRA
          queries.
              Status: Bertrand to follow up on affiliations.  No status update
              on JIRA.
    
        * Roy: Update the guidance for releases and communicate to all
          committers.
              Status: still not done
    
        * Ross: Discuss Git "documentation" with Flex PMC
              Status: completed (now a comdev issues)
    
        * Jim: Clarify Infrastructure comment from OpenMeetings report
              Status: still not done
    
        * Brett: find out what ActiveMQ needs to resolve their trademark
              question

Attachment 0: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin / Jim Jagielski]


Since this is my first report, I'm not sure exactly what format you'd
like it in, but here goes:

I've only started tracking/documenting my activities after April's Board
Meeting, when I was advised to start reporting.  It's been a relatively
slow month.


  * Daily monitoring of all email activity to ensure action items,
    and follow-up with appropriate personnel on said emails.

  * I've been involved in the discussions with ConCom regarding the
    "event-in-a-box" topic.  To date, I haven't heard of a
    confirmed date/time/city that these discussions will be taking
    place.

  * I've been monitoring email discussions from Citrix with ConCom
    and Brand Management in regards to Texas Linux Fest 2013.
    Citrix wants to choose the silver sponsorship package @Texas
    Linux Fest 2013 and donate it to the Apache CloudStack project
    in an effort to increase visibility to the project.

  * I've been monitoring the progress of BarCamp Boston, and I've
    been in communication with Matt Franklin and Ryan Baxter wrt
    how I can be of assistance.

  * I've been monitoring, and responding to, emails from Elizabeth
    re Lucene/Solr Revolution Europe 2013, and following up with
    ConCom to ensure they provided her the information she
    requested.  I also contacted Sally for an .eps of the ASF logo
    for this event.

  * I've been involved in email communications with Sally and Sharon
    (Strategic Account Manager for O'Reilly) regarding the
    application process for ASF's presence @OSCON as a non-profit
    exhibitor.

  * I've been in communication with Steve Holden re The Open Bastion
    listing me as the community sponsor contact on the CloudStack
    Collaboration Conference's website.  I also brought ConCom and
    Sally into the email thread to cover all bases.  ConCom so
    they were kept in the loop and to advise me if there is
    anything else I need to be aware of/doing as part of the
    "community sponsor contact"; and Sally for Marketing/PR
    purposes, obviously, and also because TOB are requesting a
    graphic (which is Sally's forte).

Foreseeable activities for May:

  * Continuing discussions with ConCom regarding the event-in-a-box.

  * Continuing discussions with Citrix regarding Texas Linux Fest
    2013.

  * Shipping the Apache table skirt and swag to Matt Franklin for
    the Boston BarCamp.

  * Ramping up for OSCON 2013.

  * Continuing discussion with TOB regarding the CloudStack
    Collaboration Conference.

I believe that should do it.  Let me know if there is something else I
need to do with this report, or if you will incorporate it into your
President's report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No board level issues.

For awareness, note that brand may need to request additional funding
during the upcoming budget year.  This primarily depends on both our
ability to secure pro bono services of various levels, and especially
how long it takes us to organize new trademark registrations.  While
I had planned to spend more of last year's budget, it took longer than
expected to get balls rolling; however we should roll much faster
this year.  Amount < $20K, so should not be a fundraising concern.

Trademarks has had quite a busy month with more than our fair share of
controversies and reported potential infringements from a variety of
projects.  While I can understand that many of our development
volunteers may want to see fast and decisive action on each of their
perceived issues with third party use of Apache brands, we need to
ensure that our brand enforcement is clear, correct, and effective;
this takes time to analyze issues.

Notable issues being worked on include branding use around Hadoop,
HBase, log4j, CloudStack, OFBiz, OpenOffice, and CouchDB.

It is clear both from the number of issues, how they are being brought
up, the size and types of companies that they are dealing with, and
advice from counsel that we will need to make a number of changes
in our brand management procedures.  These will include more thorough
procedures around how our projects create their brands as well as
how people report issues and how the Branding committee deals
with issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Renewals

This month has been a bumper crop. We have:
 * Silver payment from VMWare
 * Renewal from Yahoo
 * New silver sponsorship from Budget Direct in Australia
 * Bronze renewal from Talend
 * Gold payment from ComCast
 * Bronze renewal from Liip

Last month I suggested a division of labour so that I can focus on the
admin side of fundraising. Since then, I have resolved the admin side
to my satisfaction meaning I can now focus more directly on sponsor
liaison. There are automation ideas floating around, but those can be
handled at a later date.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

  I. Budget: we remain ahead of plans and under budget. No vendor
payments are due at this time. The proposed budget for FY 2013-2014
was submitted to Jim Jagielski on 13 March, and we await confirmation
of Board approval. Our news dissemination account is being renewed
with PRNewswire at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our contract with
HALO Worldwide expires on 31 May.

  II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are
planned. Sally Khudairi has been in discussions with an existing
Sponsor regarding marketing Apache Top-level Projects, as well as with
another organization regarding the ASF Sponsorship and Apache
Incubator processes.

  III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the
newswire, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this
timeperiod.

  IV. Informal Announcements: 3 items were announced on @TheASF
Twitter feed. No new posts were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed or
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.


  V. Future Announcements: no announcements are currently planned,
although some discussions have taken place with a podling contributor
regarding graduation. PMCs wishing to announce major project news —as
well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator— are welcome to
contact Sally at press@apache.org for more information. Kindly provide
at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

  VI. Media Relations: Sally responded to 7 media requests and 2
requests for project graphics/logos (she created new monochrome ASF
graphics for a request from an Apache project conference). The ASF
received 1,775 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's
clip count of 1,615.

  VII. Analyst Relations: no formal briefings are planned. Apache
was mentioned in 6 reports by Gartner, 4 write-ups by GigaOM, and 5
reports by 451 Research.

  VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no activities are planned at this time.

  IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally
continues to work with O'Reilly regarding our participation at OSCON
2013; we have been formally accepted as exhibitors in the non-profit
pavilion. Melissa Warnkin is assisting with booth tactics.

  X. Newswire accounts: we have 15 pre-paid press releases with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2013, and 7 remaining pre-paid
press releases remaining on the PRNewswire account through May 2013
which will be rolled into our balance for the new fiscal year.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Completed our budget deliberations including funding for a new
part-time position.

Purchased 3 new HP switches to replace our aging Dell switches.
Cost ~ $4700.

Continued discussion of code-signing certificates for our
projects.

Dealt with some failing/overloaded build machines in our Y!
farm.

Jan Iversen continued to work on our nagios -> circonus
service monitoring migration.

2 disks have failed in loki (tinderbox), we've replaced one from
inventory but will need to order more to complete the replacement.

Experienced some security / porn issues with the moin wiki and
have upgraded to the latest version to assist with controlling
the spam.

We will be disabling password-based ssh access to people.apache.org
in the near future, once the supporting scripts have been tested.

Rainer Jung was granted root karma and needs to be added to the
formal committee roster.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

NO REPORT


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

The W3C Advisory Board election process has started.  There are 12
candidates for 4 places.

Nothing to report this month on ASF related activity.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

Relatively quiet month.  Nothing requiring board attention.

Longest thread involved determining what constitutes a source release.
Impetus was a desire to include third party fonts in svn.  Conclusion was
that these particular fonts were made available under a Category B license
so that they could be made available, but were not the "preferred form for
making modifications" so could not be considered source.

After determining a small number of issues that need to be worked before we
consider signing a new TCK license with Oracle, I had Dan Kulp introduce Aaron
Williamson of the SFLC to discuss these issues with Oracle on our behalf.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

For Apr 2013: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications. The
previous board report was in March so this one is slightly early.

couple of committers this year. The last release was 4 months ago.
There have been no committer or PMC member changes, its been 18 months
since the last PMC addition.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======

There are no issues that we believe currently require the board's attention.

Releases
========

There have been no releases this month. The last releases were:

* apache-bloodhound-0.5.2-incubating (1st April 2013)
* apache-bloodhound-0.5.3 (15th April 2013)

A discussion about the next releases has recently begun.

Community & Development
=======================

No new committee members have been added this month. The last addition to
the committee was on 10th April 2013.

Bloodhound has submitted projects for GSoC and has put a good amount of
effort into encouraging prospective students to get involved and interact on
the mailing list. We appear to have four valid proposals from students.

In addition to the interesting discussions resulting from GSoC, the dev
mailing list has been very active covering a good range of topics. And we
appear to be remaining responsive to questions. Post graduation interest
appears to be ongoing with some more voices appearing on the dev list. We
have also seen bloodhound specific questions appearing on the external
trac-user mailing list. Although it is good to see interest anywhere, we
have attempted to encourage this kind of discussion to move to bloodhound
lists.

A conversation regarding a potential 1.0 release has also begun as we have
recently made very good progress on the initial aims of the project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

Since the last report, we have released Buildr 1.4.11 that fixed a single
regression in v1.4.10.

We have also just voted for the release of Buildr 1.4.12; this release will
contain 5 enhancements, 4 bug fixes and 2 minor changes. 3 of these were
contributed by non-committers. The mailing lists remain relatively quiet.

Our last committer addition dates back to October 2010. Our last PMC addition
dates back to September 2010, though we are currently in the voting process to
add Peter Donald (our most active committer in the past 2 years) into our PMC.

We have no issues that require board attention.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

1.1.10 14/Feb/13
1.2.2 24/Feb/13
1.2.3 17/Mar/13
1.2.4 10/Apr/13
1.1.11 18/Apr/13

Development:

The Cassandra committers held an in-person roadmap discussion in San
Mateo, CA at the end of February.  Besides those based in the Bay
area, several committers flew in from out of town.  Aleksey Yeschenko
and Jake Luciani attended remotely via Google Hangout.  General
sentiment was that the meeting was a success, but we will try our next
meeting entirely virtually over Hangout, both to reduce the travel
overhead and to make everyone more of an equal participant.

I wrote up notes of the meeting itself at [1] [2] [3].

Community:

Marcus Eriksson was added as a committer.

ISSUES


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Issues needing board attention:
 None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
 None.
 Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list continues be light but steady, people got a
bit more active around the release to give feedback. Various devs attended
the questions and provided solutions.

Releases

2.1 has been released on 2013/03/20 after 6 posivite PMC votes. Special
thanks to Cédric for his first cocoon release. 2.2 and 3 are waiting for some
blocking bugs to be closed to be released.


Development

Bugfixing on C3 and release on the 2.1 branch. Various
tickets and patches had been applied to the code base,


Security issues reported:
 None.

Progress of the project:

 One Forrest PMC member did assist to do testing prior to our 2.1.12 release
inside Forrest.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
---------------

Suresh Marru has been added to the Community Development PMC
Rich Bowen has been added to the Community Development PMC

GSoC
--------------

The ASF has been accepted to GSoC 2013, and Ulrich Stärk has volunteered to 
be our Admin for the program this year. Currently we are in the reviewing 
students proposal phase, and Google should communicate accepted students
by end of the month.

Mentoring Projects
--------------

We have been discussing a pilot mentoring project with India ICFOSS and we are 
finalizing the schedule of the program before start recruiting mentors from
the foundation projects. This project should be similar to GSoC where students
will be matched with ASF mentors and work on projects for a specific period of
time, but there are NO monetary incentives for either parts.

Other
--------------

- There has been various talks about expanding the ComDev
responsibilities, such as taking the policy documentation
responsibilities from Incubator and handling pieces of event
management from ConCom. Most of these discussions started due to
overwhelmed PMCs that have grown out of control and have taken a lot
more responsibilities that they can handle. Although these discussions
are good and should be happening, I want to make sure we don't
overwhelm the ComDev PMC with all these new responsibilities all at
once. Anyway, this is my particular view, and so far we haven't heard
concrete plans to implement these discussed items.

- The Community has revamped the ComDev website, with the goal to
enhance site navigation and information categorization to users.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brett Porter]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

As expected, activity has dropped off after the 1.4.1 release last quarter.
A contributor has recently submitted some patches related to the upgrade
that would warrant a 1.4.2 release once they are reviewed and applied.

User list activity was likewise very low, but questions were responded to.

The last release was Continuum 1.4.1, on January 7, 2013.

We have not added any new committers recently. The last committer was added
December 8, 2010 and the last PMC member was added on September 2, 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

DESCRIPTION

Apache CouchDB is a database that uses JSON for documents, JavaScript for
MapReduce queries, and regular HTTP for an API.

RELEASES

   - 1.2.2 (4th April 2013)
       -
http://www.apache.org/dist/couchdb/notes/1.2.2/apache-couchdb-1.2.2.html

   - 1.3.0 (24th April 2013)
       -
http://www.apache.org/dist/couchdb/notes/1.3.0/apache-couchdb-1.3.0.html

CURRENT ACTIVITY

   - Work is underway to merge in Cloudant's BigCouch fork which will add
     clustering capabilities to CouchDB.
   - Work is underway to merge in Cloudant's Fauxton overhaul of the
     CouchDB admin interface.
   - Work is underway to merge in parts of Benoît Chesneau's rcouch fork
     which improves the build system.
   - Work is underway to improve our test suite with a view toward making
     it more stable.
   - The documentation donation from Couchbase was merged in and shipped
     with CouchDB 1.3.0.

The docs are also available at:

    http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/

The project is undergoing an expansionist phase. The PMC is
focusing on bolstering the committer base, and the committer
base is focusing on bolstering CouchDB. As part of this, we
are also conducting several restructuring exercises. These
include: recruiting more committers, re-enforcing expectations
around consensus building and decision making processes,
re-evaluating our Git workflow, and switching to regular
time-based releases. These exercises are going very well
so far.

We have established consensus to have GitHub pull request
comment notifications sent to the development mailing list.
This will be an experiment. Our goal is to increase the
visibility of important activity that is happening away
from the lists. Our success criteria will be increased
activity and attention to contributions coming in from

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Robert Burrell Donkin]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source
software related to the auditing and comprehension of
software distributions. Any language and build system are
welcomed.

Project Status
--------------
Creadur graduated from the Apache Incubator in April, 2012.
The final handover tasks associated with the first
release are now in progress.

Issues
------
We have no issues requiring board attention at the moment.

Community
---------
More traffic on the list, and some interest in one of our
GSOC project ideas.

Stefan Bodewig has resigned from the PMC.

Releases
--------
None (yet). The last release happened while the project was
incubating: RAT 0.8 released in November 2011.

Rat 0.9 has been approved but the announcement is pending
completion of final release infrastructure handover tasks.

Whisker is waiting to be released.

Community Objectives
--------------------
* Complete release of Apache Rat 0.9
* Release Apache Whisker 0.1


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Releases:
We are currently holding a vote for our 0.6.0 release, our first
release since leaving the incubator at the end of February. We have
received three +1 votes for the current release candidate from PMC members
and expect the vote to pass when voting closes in a couple of days.

Community & Development:
No new PMC members or committers have been added since our report last
month, when we added two new committers.

We had a tough month on the dev list, primarily due to a strange and
somewhat random Java compiler error that caused Crunch builds to
fail consistently in some environments but not others, which was
frustrating to debug and caused lots of Jenkins failures. We believe
that we have resolved these issues with the latest release candidate
and are looking forward to our next release and getting back to working
on new features and bug fixes for our next release.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  Jeremias Märki (jeremias) resigned.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  Some tiny activity on the user mail list, where a "status" question was
  well handled by another PMC member.

  No activity on the dev mail list.

  Three other PMC members thanked the efforts of Jeremias. So we know that
  there are 4+ people hanging around, meaning that we can potentially still
  make decisions.

  Nice. Response to my late draft report showed that I can stop squinting.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:

  One PMC member did assist at the Apache Cocoon project to do testing
  prior to their 2.1.12 release, by testing it inside Forrest. Bumped some
  related items in our issue tracker which will hopefully stimulate some
  developer interest. We still need to follow through and update our use of
  Cocoon and blocks (especially the FOP block).

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The Apache Gora team was extremely happy to announce the release of Gora
0.3 on 8th May 2013. VOTE'ing and the release management procedure seems
to be working well for the community and it was great to get the code
released.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Generally project activity has been fairly steady. We have been working
towards our 0.3 release with one issue (flagged upstream within Nutch)
posing quite a problem from a technical viewpoint. The 0.3 release
candidate was initially delayed with the intent of addressing this issue
however a decision was made to push the RC and address it in 0.4.
The user list has seen usual very low traffic. Our dev list has seen
236, 110 and 55 posts (so far) for the months March, April and May
respectively. We've recently seen some contributions and activity
from newer community members brought to Gora by Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
The Gora community decided to move to Apache CMS for publishing documentation
and we are currently deciding on when to push the staging site live.

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have had some interest (mainly streamed down from the Nutch community)
regarding improving Gora for specific use cases and more generally.
user@gora has 33 subscribers
dev@gora has 54 subscribers
PMC members Renato and Lewis are preparing and presenting Gora at this
years Cassandra Summit in San Francisco in July. This is another attempt
to build Gora out more.
We have seen a number of students come forward and propose projects for this
years GSoC. This is great news for Gora and we are optimistic about working
to make the Gora community better.

Changes to PMC & Committers

The Gora PMC were very pleased to invite and have Roland von Herget
join our ranks on Thu, 7th Mar 2013. Roland also joined the
Gora PMC.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of Apache projects
including, Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo, Whirr & Hadoop
(this is not an exhaustive list).

which made for interesting new things to talk about at the conference.

httpd 2.2.24 was released on February 26th.

httpd 2.0.x has not seen a release since late 2010. It is likely that the next release
will be accompanied by an EOL declaration.


Bug reports
===========
Bug reporting and fixing is going at a steady pace with between a half and one 
new ticket being filed and fixed every day (68 new tickets versus 63 closed).
A total of 193 bugs have been discussed via Bugzilla within the last quarter.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]


The incubator PMC continues to have difficulties with supervision and
reporting, as evinced by set of missing reports below. [1] It's not
really clear why this problem has grown worse. Perhaps the previous
chair was more capable of harnessing the efforts of the PMC, or
perhaps it's the larger number of podlings, or perhaps it's random, or
more likely it's a combination of the above.

While there is a consensus in the PMC that there are problems, there
is not a consensus about what actions to take. Several people have
proposed changes, and all of those changes have attracted a mixture of
support and opposition.

If nothing changes, either at the level of lack of reports and other
evidence of supervision problems, or with the PMC's ability to reach a
consensus, Benson is going to ask the Board for an agenda item on the
June agenda to discuss the situation.

On the positive side, the PMC has added several new members from
inside the podlings, which is one of the schemes for getting more
supervision done.

[1] There is some evidence that Marvin failed to deliver some
reminders. If true, it is a partial explanation but not a complete
excuse.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

The project currently only has 1 active mentor, Chris Mattmann. Chris 
has been able to get Paul Ramirez and Andrew Hart, both IPMC members,
to help mentor as well when needed (e.g., with release VOTE'ing), but
it's still been pretty scarce. Chris brought this up to the IPMC in
threads before, but it went without a reply.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Ben Mahler was added as a PPMC member and committer on the project.

We've seen an increase in activity on the mailing list. Airbnb has
been increasingly using Mesos, not only for Chronos, but also for
Hadoop (using our newly written Hadoop framework). There has also been
a production engineering meetup where Mesos was presented:

s/97563092/

How has the project developed since the last report?

The project has moved its source repo to ASF Git per 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6065.

We need to get our website properly ASF branded. 
We also need to move towards more discussions on the dev list
that aren't shepherded by automated tools (Review Board, and JIRA).
This would make it easier to follow conversations, and to encourage
new contributors to be able to discuss the code, and its stewardship.

On top of the usual bug fixes and reliability improvements, we've
implemented resource monitoring to gain visibility into the resource
consumption of executors running in Mesos. We are also much closer to
shipping a feature that allows the slave to upgrade gracefully
(without killing all tasks underneath it).

MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expand the development community to include more diverse committers
  2. Complete the first release
  3. Improve query performance on large clusters

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

none

How has the community developed since the last report?

We are in the process of completing the infrastructure for the MRQL  
podling. We have created a new wiki site for MRQL that includes a  
detailed developer documentation, which includes a guide to potential  
committers on how to contribute to the MRQL project, gives a detailed  
roadmap of the codebase, and lists the future release plans. This wiki  
also contains user documentation of the MRQL query language. We have  
also created a JIRA site for MRQL. So far we have created 9 JIRA  
issues, some of them related to infrastructure improvement, from which  
6 have already been resolved.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The existing code has been substantially modified in many ways to  
facilitate contributions by committers. The codebase now includes a  
testbed of queries to automatically test various aspects of the  
system. We are now in the process of refactoring the code based on our  
coding guidelines and of using maven as our project management tool.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. work out a concrete plan towards graduation ASAP
  2. encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis
  3. reach out to other projects using .NET that might be interested
     in working with NPanday

Some new attention has sparked recently around getting support for
Mono back up to par, which might help resolve some of the regressions
that are in the way of a release. Hopefully some of the newer
contributors will be able to continue helping out in that regard.

Users have drawn attention to the fact that the home page doesn't list
any recent activity. Some effort needs to go into making it clearer of
the current status and how to contribute.

The existing committers continue to be busy with other projects, but
are still interested in seeing the project succeed and looking for new
volunteers.

We are still short on mentors, and would appreciate any volunteers.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and
manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community, especially attracting new developers.
  2. Successfully complete another podling release. 
  3. Hold an informal graduation readiness vote.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

No new committers added.  

We stalled in our 0.6 release plans when our Release Manager left due
to changing work commitments.  A new Release Manager stepped forward
and we're currently voting on a new Release Candidate.

There has also been some discussion of whether we will ever become
large enough to sustain a TLP, and whether it would make more sense to
move the code into an existing TLP, e.g., OpenOffice or POI, both of
which are related technologies.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Completed development work for 0.6 release.  Along with the usual bug
fixes, enhancements in this release include:

* Added document encryption support
* Added metadata support
* Support for OpenDocument-v1.2
* Additional APIs for Simple API

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Kurt Stam]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification for
(Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an implementation
of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

jUDDI
- We are close to releasing version 3.1.5 adding a much improved distribution
  with quickstart examples,  a way to create deployments using different JPA
or JAXWS implementations for different target platforms, lots of fixes of
bugs found by the work that is taking place on the console.
- Traffic on the mailing lists picking up, mostly people starting to use the
  examples.
- a new committer on the project (Alex) is currently working on a console
  which will be released as part of 3.2 (which we will focus on after 3.1.5)
- 3.2 will probably drop support for JDK 1.5.
- some new ideas are bounced around for as extensions to the UDDI v3 spec.
  They may likely get published as part of this project since the OASIS
committee is no longer active.

Scout
- No release this period, not really any development took place.
- Very low volume of JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Request: wiki enabled on Github.
The jUDDI project has a github mirror, and we'd like to have the wiki on
github enabled, we use a process where we maintain the docs on the wiki using
asciidoc, which can then be converted to docbook and then the html, pdf etc.
This or asciidoc support on the Apache CMS (using Gollum?). See also

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Logging Project  [Christian Grobmeier]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to the logging of application behavior.

- Community

Remko Popma joined as a committer.
We have received significant contributions from Nick Williams to log4j 2
and will most likely invite him as committer too.

There is more community participation around log4j 2
in general.

A discussion on the log4cxx lists took place on moving the
component to the attic. A couple of users were -1 to it.
According to them log4cxx is stable and valuable and should
be kept. The idea of forking it to GitHub was not accepted.
The idea of forming a new dev team from the community
and restarting it at the incubator found some interest.
A couple of people mentioned they would be willing to submit
a "few patches". However, it seems nobody is willing to take
ownership for long-term tasks like cutting releases.

In 2012, the Logging project decided on a yearly chair
election. The PMC re-confirmed the current chair to serve
for another year.

In general, the project is healthy and growing again.

- Project Branding Requirements

All components meet the branding requirements, except Chainsaw.
We are still planning for a new Chainsaw release.

- Releases

  * Log4j 2.0-beta5 (Apr 25, 2013)

- Subproject details

log4j 1, Companions: less activity, several bugs were
reported.

log4net: less activity, a few code modifications. Help
has been provided on the user list.

log4cxx: no activity (see community section).

log4php: less activity than last quarter.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for
connecting source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and
EMC Documentum, to target repositories or indexes, such as Apache
Solr, OpenSearchServer or ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a
security model for target repositories that permits them to enforce
source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since
then, there have been three major releases, including a 1.1.1 release
on February 13, 2013, and another major release is undergoing voting
right now.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Minoru Osuka
(minoru), on January 10, 2013.  We are voting on a new committer and
PMC member at the time of this writing also.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of
our connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies.  Dev
list comments centered around new committers, release-related
communication, and voting.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.


Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now
compliant with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in
logos from other Apache products that don't have any such marks.
Hopefully we will be able to correct this issue soon.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache River Project  [Greg Trasuk]

Apache River is a Java-based Service Oriented Architecture, implementing
the Jini Specification and Jini Technology Starter Kit originally
donated by Sun Microsystems.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

There are no board-level issues at this time

RELEASES

Apache River 2.2.1 was released on May 2, 2013.  At time of writing the
release has been approved by the PMC but not announced yet (just waiting
for the distribution mirrors).  We also expect to release artifacts for
version 2.2.1 to the Maven repository in the near future (these will be
subject to another release vote as we understand it).  The last previous
release was 2.2.0 in July 0f 2011.

COMMUNITY

No new committers have been added since Nov of 2011, although a couple of
emeritus committers have showed up on the mailing list in recent months.
We hope that with releases coming on a more regular basis, user interest will
pick up, and with it we will attract more potential new committers.

ACTIVITY

There has been significant activity around the release.  The 2.2.1
release was a maintenance release of the 2.2 branch.  In the time since
the 2.2 branch there have been a large number of changes to the trunk
code and the QA test code, particularly in regards to concurrency
issues, leading to some debate around the confidence level in the trunk
code.  Basically, we feel that we waited far too long between releases.
With the 2.2.1 maintenance release out of the way, the community is
discussing how to proceed with release of the trunk code (which will
likely become the 2.3 stream).  Also, we are discussing a switch to
Review-then-Commit procedure on the trunk code (previously we had
specified RTC only on API changes, but Commit-then-Review on the
implementation code).  The discussions have been at times spirited, but
generally cordial.

There have been some suggestions that we should consider switching to
Git for version control.  We're watching other project's experiences
with interest.

well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on Roller 5.0.1.

Issues

No board issues at this time.

Releases

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0.1, which was released
on June 24, 2012, a security and bug fix release.

Community

Since our last report the community has continued to clean-up the
JIRA issue list, make simplifications in the Roller codebase and
re-organize the Roller source into a smaller number of Maven
modules.

Apart from that, the Roller community continues to be rather quiet
with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and installation
issues.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of
security standards for XML.

There was one new release in the last quarter - version 1.5.4 of the XML
Security for Java project was released on the 18th of March. This release was
a minor bug fix release. Overall project activity was quiet, with some ongoing
work on a new major 2.0 release of the XML Security for Java project. The
svnpubsub migration was also completed during the last quarter.

Santuario has added a new PMC member in the last quarter - Marc Giger.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation
of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:

RangeSet class[1] was started by Martin D and worked on by Joe White.
Resolved a blocking issue with XML prefix mappings [2]

An implementation of the ISO 19115 standard (Geographic information
--- Metadata --- Part 1: Fundamentals) has been committed in the
"org.apache.sis.metadata.iso" package and sub-packages [3]. This
implementation contains about 100 public classes defined by the
international standard, plus about as many internal classes in
support of XML marshalling. Dynamic (read/write) views of metadata
property as java.util.Map and as TreeTable have been provided using
reflection mechanism similar to JavaBeans. Those views are used
today for rich toString() representations, and will be used later
for metadata edition in Graphical User Interfaces.

Next Release:

Release of Apache SIS 0.3 is planned as soon as the following work
has been completed (tentatively this month):

   * A bridge from NetCDF files conforming to the CF-1.5 conventions,
     to the ISO 19115 metadata. This bridge would provides to SIS
     users a first "real" source of data they can use with SIS
     metadata implementation.
   * Complete and test the XML marshalling of metadata objects. This
     marshalling shall be compliant to the ISO 19139 (Geographic
     information -- Metadata -- XML schema implementation) standard.

Community:

Mattmann was invited to present at at the Geospatial FOSS NOAA meetup
right outside of Washington DC. This meetup was hosted by OpenGeo and
there are currently 64 members.

Harash Kumar is currently evaluating how to to couple SIS and Apache
Airavata as part of an ongoing research project he is working on.

Apache SIS to participate in Google Summer of Code!

Branding:

The SIS Website is finally ported to the Apache CMS from the old
incubator site. Wahoo! We are now working on getting it cleaned up
and looking great! Many thanks to Suresh Marru in helping us get
everything working properly.

Setup a review board for SIS here[4]

Press:
The new SIS website is now updated and live.

Issues:
We were having systematic JVM crash on the Solaris node, while it
worked well on Ubuntu. We did not really fixed the problem, but
just avoid it for now by forcing the builds to occur on the Ubuntu
nodes. We have some ideas about what may cause the JVM crash, which
we will try after the SIS release.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  elego is sponsoring a hackathon in Berlin again. Unlike past years,
  this is being run independent of a paid conference. This will happen
  next month (June), lasting for a week. The Subversion community has
  greatly benefited from these hackathons and is looking forward to
  attending again.

  We added one new committer (rschupp).
  
  Our last PMC Member was added in March, 2012.
  
* Releases

  1.8.0-rc2 has been produced for the community to evaluate. We expect
  the 1.8.0 release to occur in June. When that happens, we will fully
  deprecate the 1.5.x series, according to Subversion policy. The
  1.6.x series will receive only security updates, and 1.7.x will
  continue receive useful, important, and security updates.
  
  Since our February report, Subversion 1.6.21 was released on April
  4th (to tigris.org); this was primarily a security release. In
  addition, Apache Subversion 1.7.9 was released on the same day to
  fix the same set of security issues. The Security Team helped the
  PMC with CVE generation, and overall assistance.

LATE NOTE: the versioning policy described above is incorrect. Please
see subversion.apache.org and our report next month. In short: 1.6.x
will be fully deprecated and receive no updates.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

It's been relatively quiet on the development front. A few bugs
were fixed and some JIRA issues were resolved.

There were a few students who expressed an interest in working on
Xerces-J for GSoC though none of them created a formal proposal.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 125+ posts on the
j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of February 2013.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Several users have asked for the release of version 3.2.0, in order
to include the latest fixes (including the support for Visual
Studio 2012). A proposal has been made to include support for the
XML 1.0 5th edition in the 3.2.0 release. A few users have
volunteered to do testing on various platforms. We are hopeful that
the new version will be ready in the coming weeks.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 120+ posts on the
c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of February 2013.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-C 3.1.1 (April 27th, 2010).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Some minor improvements were made to the JAXP ObjectFactory classes
to better align them with similar classes in Xerces-J and Xalan-J.
No postings to the mailing list this quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

There's still some work left to do on the TLP website, including
adding "TM" to the project logo.

General

After reaching consensus with the community an admin group was set
up for the Xerces Wiki to put an end to the SPAM that was
frequently being posted to it.
