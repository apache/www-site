license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0


The Apache Software Foundation licenses its trademarks and logos to a variety of entities that sell Apache-branded merchandise and contribute some or all of the profits to the Foundation.
If you wish to design and order your own merchandise for personal use and have it produced by your preferred supplier then as long as you follow the requirements of our [merchandise policy](/foundation/marks/merchandise) then you may do so.
We provide [high resolution logos](https://www.apache.org/logos/) for each of our projects for you to use.
Those wishing to license the ASF and/or Apache Project logos for merchandising (swag, apparel, pins, stickers, etc.) for non-personal use may [contact ASF Brand Management](/foundation/marks/merchandise) for further details.

We are currently establishing a number of ASF managed stores where you may purchase ASF merchandise.
Sometimes these stores add new merchandise items with an automated logo placement.
This logo placement might not always be ideal.
Please check the logo placement carefully before purchase and, if you have any concerns, reach out to the Community Development project via the [dev@community mailing list](https://community.apache.org/lists.html) who will be able to correct the logo placement before you order.

We currently have the following store available and are working to expland the number of stores as well as the range of both the merchandise and projects offered.
These stores are generally operated at cost or, where that option is not available, at the lowest price available for that platform.

You may wish to compare costs (don't forget tax, shipping and - if shipping internationally - customs charges) as part of deciding which store to use.
Remember, for personal use you always have the option of ordering locally from your preferred supplier.

If the project or merchandise item you are looking for isn't available, please do let us know via the [dev@community mailing list](https://community.apache.org/lists.html) and we'll do our best to get it added.

Those interested in items from the ASF's earlier days and who want to contribute a portion of each sale's proceeds may find what they're looking for at:
