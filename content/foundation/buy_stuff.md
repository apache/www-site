The Apache Software Foundation licenses its trademarks and logos to a variety of entities that sell Apache-branded merchandise and contribute some or all of the profits to the Foundation. Those wishing to license the ASF and/or Apache Project logos for merchandising (swag, apparel, pins, stickers, etc.) may [contact ASF Brand Management](/foundation/marks/contact#swag) for further details.

We used to have an online store for ASF merchandise, but as of May 2024 it's been closed and we do not have a replacement yet.

Those interested in items from the ASF's earlier days and who want to contribute a portion of each sale's proceeds may find what they're looking for at:

-  [ASF Swag](http://asfswag.com/) -- created by ASF Member Shane Curcuru
-  [The Rodent's Cache](http://www.cafepress.com/meepzor/230676) -- created by ASF Member Ken Coar
