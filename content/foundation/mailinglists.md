Title: Mailing Lists
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Publicly archived mailing lists are critical to the operation of the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF) and to our many [Apache
Projects](http://projects.apache.org/).  Apache projects use mailing lists to coordinate
development of their software and administer their organization. Mailing
lists also serve as a primary support channel where users can help each
other learn to use the software.

Mailing list participants are expected to abide by the well-established rules of
"netiquette", as well as the ASF's published [Code of Conduct](/foundation/policies/conduct.html).
 We also have [Tips for email
contributors](../dev/contrib-email-tips.html).

Please be aware that email sent to Apache developer or user mailing lists is subject to our 
[Public Forum Archive Policy](public-archives.html). 

Note that some Apache mailing lists are not public; they are often but not always named 
**private@**. Be sure not to take emails from private discussions or mailing lists 
into a public forum or list unless there is agreement by all parties to the conversation.

# Moderation of posts #

Most lists require a poster to be subscribed.
If you are not subscribed, your post requires moderation.
This may take hours or days, so it's best to subscribe (as described below) before posting.

# Subscribing and Unsubscribing  {#subscribing}

Unless otherwise noted, ASF lists are managed by
[ezmlm](http://untroubled.org/ezmlm/), which lets users subscribe or unsubscribe by sending an email to a special address.
This works as follows:

* Send the request to the appropriate address (see below)
* ezmlm sends a reply; either a confirmation request or an error message (e.g. if you are not subscribed)
* Reply to the confirmation message

ASF committers can also use the Whimsy [Mailing List Self-subscription](https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/subscribe) service.

### Request addresses for [un]subscribing ###

If you want to subscribe
to <code><em>list</em>@apache.org</code>, you need to send a message to

<pre>
<em>list</em>-subscribe@apache.org
</pre>

To get off a list, send a message to

<pre>
<em>list</em>-<b>un</b>subscribe@apache.org
</pre>

To unsubscribe a different e-mail - e.g.
you used to be subscribed as **`user@oldname.example`** - send a message
to

<pre>
<em>list</em>-unsubscribe-<b>user=oldname.example</b>@apache.org
</pre>

[The list moderators can also do this.]

If you do not recall the address you used when you subscribed, view the full headers
of any email you received from the list and examine the `Return-Path`,
`Received`, and `List-ID` headers; these should embed both the address you are
subscribed as and the address of the mailing list.

Note: Spam filters don't like messages with empty Subjects; just put
"subscribe" or "unsubscribe" in the header field. Spam filters are also more likely to reject
HTML-formatted messages; please use plain text.

### Request confirmation ###

After you send the subscribe or unsubscribe request, the list manager
sends you a confirmation e-mail in reply. **You must reply to this e-mail to
complete the process.** If you have not received the confirmation request,
check that it has not been marked as spam.

**Note: private lists generally require a moderator to confirm the subscription**.
This may take a day or two. If necessary, try again after a few days.
For this reason we recommend that ASF and PMC members use
[the self-subscribe app](https://whimsy.apache.org/committers/subscribe) to avoid having to wait for the human moderators to check and green-light your subscription request.

### Other list commands ###

To find out more about a list's features, including how to contact the list owner (moderator),
send a message to 

<pre>
<em>list</em>-help@apache.org
</pre>

Ezmlm lists also generally provide subscribers with a way to request
specific past messages or ranges of messages: send mail to the list's help
address to find out more. This can act as a sort of 'poor man's archive' if
the normal archives are inaccessible or don't exist.

All ASF committers can get a list of (a) what email addresses are known to the
ASF as belonging to them (b) what mailing lists they are moderating, and (c)
what mailing lists they are subscribed to by going to the following page:

  [https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committer/\_\_self\_\_](https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committer/__self__)

### Digest Subscriptions

You can also subscribe to most mailing lists in digest form. To do this for <tt>*list*@apache.org</tt>, send a message to

<pre>
<em>list</em>-digest-subscribe@apache.org
</pre>

To get off a digest list, send a message to

<pre>
<em>list</em>-digest-<b>un</b>subscribe@apache.org
</pre>

If you need to unsubscribe a different email or get help with a digest list the same instructions as for subscribing/unsubscribing 
above apply. Just remember to add *-digest* after the list name and before the *-subscribe* or *-unsubscribe*.

# Moderators  {#moderators}

Each mailing list generally has several moderators who look after the list.
For further information, see the
[Committers FAQ - Mail Questions](/dev/committers.html#mail)

# Mailing List Archives  {#archives}

Archives for public mailing lists are available at a number of locations,
including:

-  [Apache Mail Archives](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/) 

-  [MarkMail](http://apache.markmail.org/) 

-  [MARC](http://marc.info/) 

-  [mail-archive.com](http://mail-archive.com/) 

# Project Mailing Lists #

Links to project-specific mailing list info can be found on the [project
resources page](http://projects.apache.org/projects.html).

Tip: if you have a technical question of any kind, the best place to ask is the 
user@ or dev@ list for the relevant project - Foundation level mailing lists 
or other Apache contact emails (including individuals' emails) will not be able to help you

The `legal-discuss@apache.org` is a forum for questions (even FAQs) that
have a legal aspect. These questions may concern (for example)
licensing, third party packages, contributor agreement questions and
trademark issues. This list will build into an ad-hoc knowledge base about
those thorny legal issues that most commonly effect Apache projects. Please
keep speculation to a minimum and avoid making authoritative statements
without genuine knowledge of the subject.

Volunteers willing to codify discussions into a FAQ are welcome.
