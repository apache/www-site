# ASF Initiatives

ASF Initiatives are specific Targeted Sponsorships that provide additional financial support for Foundation governance operations, open source projects, and project communities. 

The first to launch is the ASF Tooling Initiative (March 2025), created to meet the growing global demand for ASF software by hardening ubiquitous Apache projects that benefit the greater open source ecosystem.

## Tooling Initiative 

The [Tooling Initiative](http://tooling.apache.org/) helps ASF’s open source project communities streamline development, automate repetitive tasks, reduce technical debt, and better collaborate. Additional Initiatives are in the planning stages including security capabilities that meet the EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and US’s CISA recommendations. New products being developed under the Tooling Initiative are separate from the tools developed by ASF Infrastructure.

The Initiative requires an increase to the ASF's annual budget by $500K to maintain the Foundation's commitment to the highest standards of software development and community support. To meet these financial goals, the ASF has launched a new fundraising campaign to fund its Tooling Initiative. We thank [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/) for contributing funds to seed the initiative.
