The easiest way to contact the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is via
e-mail. Note that depending on your area of inquiry, there are a number of
different e-mail addresses or lists to use.

**Before** sending mail to the address below, **make sure** that  the information on the [Contact Apache
FAQ](preFAQ.html) doesn't already address your issue. If it is, the only response you'll receive is a pointer
to that page, and you will have wasted your time and ours. So **please**
check that page first!

## Technical contact addresses

**Remember:** address all technical questions and questions
about any of our projects or software products to the
[appropriate project-specific mailing list](preFAQ.html#projects).
There may be no response to technical questions you send to one of the organizational e-mail addresses below.

## Non-technical contact addresses

**Key non-technical contact addresses for the ASF include:** 

- **Queries from the press** (NOT support
questions or anything else!) go to our media relations address:
**press@apache.org**. See the [Public Relations](/press/) page for more
details.

- If you believe you've **found a security vulnerability** in any ASF
product, contact our security address: **security@apache.org**. See
the [Security](/security/) page for more details. We keep all security-related
information confidential unless otherwise indicated. Note that we will not reply from this address to
any emails **not** relating to security vulnerabilities.

- For problems with the foundation top-level **websites** (such as
`http://www.apache.org/`,
`http://people.apache.org/`,
`http://home.apache.org/`,
`http://projects.apache.org`, but excluding Web sites of individual Apache
Projects), please email **press@apache.org**. Issues with any individual 
Apache project's web page should go to that project's dev@ mailing list. 

- If you are interested in **donating funds** to the Apache Software
Foundation, see our information on [contributing to the
ASF](contributing.html).

- If you are interested in becoming a **major sponsor** of the Apache
Software Foundation, see our information on [Sponsoring the
ASF](sponsorship.html).

- Issues related to **trademarks or service marks** of the ASF (including all 
Apache project names and logos) that are not answered by the [formal Trademark Policy](marks/), 
[Brand FAQ](marks/faq), and [Trademark Resources](marks/resources) should go to
the [Brand Management Committee](marks/contact).

- For all **legal or licensing issues**, see our [Licensing FAQ](/foundation/license-faq.html) and if that doesn't help, 
contact the [Legal Affairs Committee](/legal/).

- For **DMCA Designated agent** information, see our [DMCA Agent](/legal/dmca.html).

If you have a question that is not covered by one of the above pages or
e-mail addresses, the main **non-technical** contact address for the Apache
Software Foundation is: **apache@apache.org**.
