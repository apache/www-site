## How To Request Trademark Use Permissions For Apache Brands

### Uses in Events or Conferences  {#events}

Review the [Third Party Event Branding Policy][events] and ensure your 
plans comply with the policy **first**.  Then send an email confirming 
your compliance with all points in the Event policy, and asking for 
permission (or with any questions), to the relevant project list 
below **and** cc: to `trademarks@apache.org`:

- [Apache Hadoop&reg; Event Requests](mailto:trademarks@hadoop.apache.org?subject=%5bEVENT%5d%20Hadoop%20Event%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache CloudStack&reg; Event Requests](mailto:private@cloudstack.apache.org?subject=%5bEVENT%5d%20CloudStack%20Event%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache OpenOffice&reg; Event Requests](mailto:private@openoffice.apache.org?subject=%5bEVENT%5d%20OpenOffice%20Event%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache Subversion&reg; Event Requests](mailto:private@subversion.apache.org?subject=%5bEVENT%5d%20Subversion%20Event%20branding%20use%20request)
- [All Other Apache Project Event Requests](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5bEVENT%5d%20Event%20branding%20use%20request)

### Uses in Domain Names  {#domains}

Review the [Third Party Domain Name Branding Policy][domains] and ensure your 
plans comply with the policy **first**.  Then send an email confirming 
your compliance with all points in the Domain policy, and asking for 
permission (or with any questions), to the relevant project list 
below, **and** cc: to `trademarks@apache.org`:

- [Apache Hadoop&reg; Domain Name Requests](mailto:trademarks@hadoop.apache.org?subject=%5bDOMAIN%5d%20Hadoop%20Domain%20Name%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache CloudStack&reg; Domain Name Requests](mailto:private@cloudstack.apache.org?subject=%5bDOMAIN%5d%20CloudStack%20Domain%20Name%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache OpenOffice&reg; Domain Name Requests](mailto:private@OpenOffice.apache.org?subject=%5bDOMAIN%5d%20OpenOffice%20Domain%20Name%20branding%20use%20request)
- [Apache Subversion&reg; Domain Name Requests](mailto:private@subversion.apache.org?subject=%5bDOMAIN%5d%20Subversion%20Domain%20Name%20branding%20use%20request)
- [All Other Apache Project Domain Name Requests](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5bDOMAIN%5d%20Domain%20Name%20branding%20use%20request)

### Uses for Merchandise (swag, apparel, pins, stickers, etc.)  {#swag}

We have published our [merchandise guidelines](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/merchandise ) separately.

### Uses in Software Products  {#products}

Since the primary goods of any Apache project are software products 
provided [free of charge][free] to the general public, we generally do not allow third parties 
to use Apache brands in their software product branding.

You may be eligible to use our [Powered By][poweredby] branding style
in your software product naming, which does not require permissions as long 
as you follow *all* aspects of the policy, in particular **always** using the 
"Apache *Projectname*" form.

Separately, we offer a set of [Powered By Apache][poweredbylogo] logos that you
may use to show support for or use of various Apache software projects.

### Uses in Software Hosting, Training, or any Related Services  {#services]

We are currently working on guidelines that allow simpler use of Apache 
brands in such situations in ways that improve the image and reach 
of Apache projects, and that don't imply endorsement or affiliation 
between your organization and the ASF or Apache projects.  

For the time being, please email [trademarks@](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5bHOSTED%5d%20Services%20branding%20use%20request)

## Report Trademark Problems Or Make Complaints  {#complaint}

The ASF and Apache projects strive to be respectful of the trademarks of 
other organizations.  If you have a concern or complain about use of *your* 
trademarks by any Apache project **hosted on an apache.org domain**, please 
[contact us directly](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5btrademark%5d%20Trademark%20use%20complaint).

## For PMCs or Committers  {#pmc}

Apache PMC members or committers with questions about Apache brand policies or with any 
other questions or suggestions should [email the privately-archived trademarks@ list](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5bPMC%5d%20Trademark%20policy%20question) directly.

In general, cc:'ing your projects private@ PMC list is almost always a good idea too.

## Legal Counsel & All Other Questions  {#other}

For any general questions not addressed above, send a private email to: 

- [Apache Hadoop&reg; Trademark Questions](mailto:trademarks@hadoop.apache.org?subject=%5bBRAND%5d%20Hadoop%20I%20have%20a%20question)
