Title: Apache Project Branding Policy
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

This **Apache&reg; Project Website Branding Policy** defines how Apache projects
must refer to trademarks and requires a few specific elements on websites.
The [site map of trademark resources][resources] is also helpful.

# Apache Project Website Branding Policy  {#introduction}

This document defines the branding and trademark policies for
how Apache&reg; projects must display certain elements 
on their websites, and treat all trademarks - Apache's and those of other 
organizations - appropriately. [The PMC Branding Responsibilities](responsibility.html) also explains
how PMC members must manage their project's brands in other ways.

# Project Website And URL Policy: Use *.apache.org  {#websites}

  - Apache projects must host official website content on an
    `apache.org` domain. This includes content overseen by the
    project's PMC (including the top level website, download pages, and wikis),
    ensures that the ASF infrastructure team can maintain the
    services, and informs users that the content is official
    and comes from the ASF and the project's PMC, and not from a third party.

  - The homepage for any *ProjectName* must be served from
    `http[s]://ProjectName.apache.org`, to ensure consistent branding
    and to allow for automatically generated links (like
    [https://projects.apache.org](https://projects.apache.org)). All
    primary links to the project as a whole must point directly to the
    homepage, and not to alternative sites or domains.

  - Projects are free to use any [infrastructure-supported
    technology][1] to manage and deploy their websites, and are
    free to use any look and feel in its design. In the future, we
    may ask projects to add a specific style or graphical element
    (from a choice of several variants) for their link back to
    www.apache.org that will help give users a better sense of
    the connection between all Apache projects.
    
  - New communities joining the Apache Incubator which have a long 
    open-source development history with a large userbase should 
    read about [limitations on using non-apache.org domains](#nonapache).

# Project Naming Policy  {#naming}

The following guidelines are providing to help podlings and projects choose an
appropriate name:

  - "Apache" is our main trademark, or "house mark", for our overall software
    development process. All Apache projects and podlings share it.
  - All top level projects (TLPs) must use the format Apache Foo for their
    branding. However, people in informal conversation will refer to your
    project as just "Foo", so choose the name carefully.
  - Use internet search tools to be sure that there is no "similar" product,
    i.e. software for a specific purpose.
  - When people conduct an internet search after hearing about an ASF project,
    they will use some technical terms and a name. We want to appear near the
    top of the search results and not get confused with some other project in
    the same technical space.
  - Avoiding search-results confusion is important for another reason. Apache
    projects are often very quickly highly ranked. An Apache project with a
    similar name to another application in the same technical space may quickly
    come to dominate searches in that space. If someone else holds a related
    trademark, this may lead to a legal dispute. As a non-profit organization,
    the ASF and Apache projects have no business conflicting with an existing
    trademark for software products or related services.
  - Even if a product name cannot be found via a search, if you are aware that
    it, or one very like it, is in use for a similar product then we cannot use
    it.
  - You may want to choose a name that is easy to remember, is not too long, and
    is not difficult to spell.
  - Be culturally sensitive and avoid names that might offend. In particular,
    names with Native American connections will not be approved.
  - Consider using functional names, especially for products of existing
    projects, e.g. for an "Apache Foo" project, the product name "Apache Foo
    Pipelines".
  - Be good citizens. Do unto others as you would expect that they should do
    unto you. For example, treat the product names of others with respect: do
    not try a twist that is close to the name of a similar product.
  - Choose a sensible name early in the product's development, before you
    develop mailing lists, package names, logos, and other marketing collateral.
    Better to spend time now - your project will not want to change its
    product's name later.
  - See this as an important marketing opportunity, rather than a bother.
  - By carefully validating the uniqueness of our product and project names and
    clearly establishing first use in the field, we reduce the chances of future
    confusion.

# Project Branding And Descriptions Policy {#branding}

  - <a id="projectname"></a>The primary branding for any project or product
name must be in the form of "Apache *Projectname*". This ensures that users associate the project or
product with the ASF as a whole, and that third parties cannot easily misuse our project names.
The first and most prominent references to a project or product on
every page, and uses in page titles or headers, must use the "Apache *Projectname*" form of the name. Other references may
use either "Apache *Projectname*" or "*Projectname*" as appropriate for the context.

  - <a id="markdesc"></a>Every product homepage and any overview download page
for the product must include a prominent reference to the product as
"Apache Foo software", and must include a brief, one-sentence description of the purpose and
function of the software product itself. For example:

>The Apache Xerces XML parsing library software provides a complete
implementation of the XML 1.0 parsing specification, and is easily configurable and
compliant with current standards.

This description is useful for new readers to your page, and helps the ASF maintain an overall list of trademarks for our
software products. A trademark is only important when associated with a
specific kind of goods: in our case with the actual downloadable software products
that the ASF and our PMCs provide.

Note that it's helpful to share the proposed sample description with trademarks@, to
ensure it's a proper trademark goods description. For
example, in the past Apache Tomcat's website said it was an
"implementation" and a "collaboration", not a product with functionality. Apache SpamAssassin's website
described itself as a "project" and a "version" and otherwise referred to the
software as "it". Neither of these contained a proper trademark goods
description (i.e. computer software that performs a function). While
this trademark description style may sometimes seem clumsy in technical
documentation, it is a critical way that we can enforce our trademarks. It only needs to be done in one prominent place on the website for each project.


  - Always present the <a id="adjective"></a>project and product names in a consistent
casing and as an adjective, and never as a noun or verb, which is how any
trademark should be used. This is important to do on your project
homepage and on the download page; at other places on the website
or in technical product documentation it's not required.

  - We consider the names of all projects, subprojects, and products to be
trademarks of the ASF. While not all bare product names (i.e. just "Foo")
may be exclusive trademarks of the ASF, all names in the form of "Apache
Foo" should be exclusive to the ASF.

**Terminology:** a **project** or **subproject** is a community and any
associated products that are managed by a PMC; the same brand guidelines
apply to both. A **product** is a specific, downloadable software product
that our users might want to use in some way. There are a few
specific requirements for product branding. Note that *most* projects and
subprojects release a product with the same name (i.e. the Apache Foo
project releases a software product called Apache Foo).

# Website Navigation Links Policy  {#navigation}

Whatever main navigation system your project website uses, it must feature
certain text links back to key pages on the main `www.apache.org` website. These
links can appear in whatever main navigation system your site uses on
all top level pages for the project or subproject.

- "License" should link to: `www.apache.org/licenses/`

- "Sponsorship" or "Donate" should link to:
`www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html`

- "Sponsors", "Thanks" or "Thanks to our Sponsors" should link to:
`www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html`

- "Security" should link to either to a project-specific page detailing how
users may securely report potential vulnerabilities, or to the main
[www.apache.org/security/](//www.apache.org/security/) page

- "Privacy" should link to:
`privacy.apache.org/policies/privacy-policy-public.html`

- All projects must feature some prominent link back to the main ASF
homepage at `www.apache.org`. This
may either be a featured link in your main navigation system or a
text link in your Main homepage text. A best practice is to include a short
sentence or paragraph on the homepage noting that this project is an Apache
project, and is part of a larger community of developers and users.

If you have suggestions for the texts for links pointing back to
the main ASF pages that better fit with
your project's web presence, please let `trademarks@` know.

**Including "Thanks" links to third parties** - if your project
typically has companies that donate software licenses or support to
project committers, please follow the [Corporate Recognition Guidelines][2].
It is important to ensure any such pages are presented publicly in a
manner that is distinctly different from material related to the formal Sponsorship program.


# https or http?  {#httphttps}

Projects are free to use http, https or protocol relative
links for the  mandatory links required by the website navigation links policy.

We recommend, but do not require, that projects:

  - Use https for links where the target automatically switches to https when http is used

  - Use protocol relative links for all other targets


# Trademark Attributions Policy  {#attributions}

  - <a id="asfmarks"></a>All project or product homepages must feature a
prominent trademark attribution of all applicable Apache trademarks. Other project
pages should feature attributions of any marks displayed thereon. For
example:

>Apache Foo, Foo, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache Foo
project logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of The Apache
Software Foundation in the United States and other countries.

   This may appear in page footers or in any other appropriate location.

  - At the top of each project or product homepage, and on the top banner of
each page where the project name appears, you should include the appropriate &trade; or &reg; symbol
next to the **first** main occurrence of the "Apache Foo" project name, both
in header/title text and at the name's first appearance in running text.
This highlights our trademark claim and emphasizes its importance to us.

  - <a id="othermarks"></a>You must give proper attribution to any other
organization's trademarks that your website refers to. All non-ASF
trademarks must be attributed to their owners when displayed on ASF project
websites. You may do this specifically for each referred mark, or
generically; it is typically done in the footer of a webpage. For a
specific example:

>FooBar and the FooBar logo are trademarks of Yoyodyne, Inc.

To provide a generic trademark attribution (to cover cases where a
large number of marks are used, or in case we're not sure which words are
other organizations' marks), you can add instead:

>All other marks mentioned may be trademarks or registered trademarks of
their respective owners.

# Logos and Graphics Policy  {#graphics}

  - <a id="marklogo"></a>Logos are important to recognize as trademarks as
well. For the project's official logo (if it has one, and especially if it
uses the ASF feather), ensure that it includes a small "TM" symbol in the
graphic or immediately adjacent to it. For pages that include the project
logo on them, ensure you mention "... and the Project logo are
trademarks..." in the attribution.

  - Projects may choose to use the Apache feather in their logo. For details on the proper [Apache visual identity and feather graphics][3],
please work with press@.

# Powered By... Logos  {#poweredby}

We encourage projects to create a variation of their main logo as a
"Powered By..." or " *Project* Inside" logo. Third parties may use this logo
to denote that they build products or services using the associated
product. While we must ensure that the main product logo is associated with
the actual product that the Apache project provides, we allow third parties
to [more broadly use "Powered by..." logos](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#poweredby)
 in conjunction with their own products.

[Powered By Apache logos](//www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/#poweredby)
are available for all projects to use (or request updates to).

# Project Metadata  {#metadata}

<a id="doap"></a>All projects must provide a DOAP - Description Of A
Project - file or entry for both the project itself and all product
releases that they make - **OR** otherwise provide structured
data such that the projects.apache.org website can find it. Follow the [guidelines
at](https://projects.apache.org/about.html) to make a DOAP file and
register it. This will allow the ASF to best showcase all of its projects
and products in a variety of ways.

Update [Apache Trademark Lists](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/list/), briefly describing each software product.
In the future, we hope to generate this list from DOAP files of all products.

# Other Trademark Requirements  {#other}

If your project has subprojects that are software-language-specific, be
sure to name them appropriately. For example, "Apache Xerces Perl" is not
appropriate, since it improperly uses the trademark "Perl". A better
project name would be "Apache Xerces for Perl". The ASF could
allow a third party named FooBar to ship a software product called "FooBar
Software for Apache Xerces" or "BarFoo Services for Apache Xerces". The ASF
would not allow Foobar to use "FooBar Xerces" or "BarFoo Xerces" forms of a name, since Xerces is our trademark. The same applies to the use
of the word "Perl" (which is [a trademark of The Perl
Foundation](https://www.perlfoundation.org/trademarks.html) ).

**Registered Trademarks** If a PMC would like to request legal registration
of their project's trademarks, [follow the REGREQUEST instructions][4].

## Project-Related Non-apache.org Domain Names  {#nonapache}

To ensure consistent branding and assure users that content is official and 
from the ASF and our PMCs, all existing projects must host all content managed 
by the PMC on the ProjectName.apache.org domain.

**IMPORTANT:** Projects may **not** use domain names owned by third parties to host
official project content.  The content must be migrated, or the domain 
registration must be transferred to the ASF.

**If** a new community coming to the Apache Incubator has a long history 
of using an existing domain name, and has a significant userbase, 
the podling may *request* to keep these names for **limited uses**
once the podling graduates to TLP.

**Steps for podlings with non-apache.org domains**

- During Incubation, the PPMC must work with Apache Infrastructure 
  to formally transfer any needed domain name registrations to the ASF.
  As a non-profit, the ASF expects that these will be donated.  
  Create an INFRA Jira ticket to officially request that the
  ASF take over ownership of the donated domain namep.
  
- The PPMC should send their plan of how they intend to use their 
  non-apache.org domains to Brand Management/trademarks@ for approval.

- During Incubation, the PPMC must transition all development-oriented 
  information and the primary project homepage to the 
  official ProjectName.apache.org homepage. This is required 
  before a project may graduate.

**Factors to consider for use of non-apache.org domains**

- The primary development homepage, which includes all the common things that a
potential contributor would need to find out about before deciding whether to join the project,
must be hosted at *ProjectName*.apache.org.

- Major links promoting the project to likely contributors should always
point to *ProjectName*.apache.org resources directly, and not to non-apache.org domains.

- In most cases, non-apache.org domains should simply redirect to some place within the
ProjectName.apache.org/path domain, unless the podling has *each* of these really
good reasons to use a non-apache.org domain:

-- The domain was very well-known by the user and contributor
communities long before the project came to the ASF.

-- The domain is only used to provide *end user* level information.

-- The domain is Apache branded in appearance just as a.o sites are,
and offers clear and prominent links directly to project.a.o/path for
all likely contributor topics, like downloads, API docs, and mailing lists.

**Examples of non-apache.org domain approvals**

These are exceptions, and are not the case for the majority of new projects:

- openoffice.org is a user-facing portal with a huge history and millions of
users on it. Continuing that as a user portal is important to serve the 
existing non-technical users.

- groovy-lang.org is long-running, user-facing portal. This domain is 
  still used as an end-user portal with information about the Groovy 
  language. Developer information (for contributors to the 
  Groovy codebase), discussions, and downloads are all on the 
  expected groovy.apache.org website.

# Project Branding Checklist  {#checklist}

All Apache top level projects should comply fully with these guidelines.
Any projects which are not compliant must work with trademarks@ to ensure that they become compliant.
All Incubator podlings must either comply with all requirements before graduation, or
have a specific and short-term action plan to complete compliance soon after
graduation (in case there are technical issues with website updates, etc.).

Contact trademarks@ directly with branding questions - there is no
 longer any need to include this in your board reports.

**Project Branding Report Checklist**
-  [Project Website Basics](#websites) : homepage is project.apache.org

-  [Project Naming And Descriptions](#naming) : use proper Apache forms,
describe product, etc.

-  [Website Navigation Links](#navigation) : navbar links included, link to
www.apache.org included

-  [Trademark Attributions](#attributions) : attribution for all ASF marks
included in footers, etc.

-  [Logos and Graphics](#graphics) : include TM, use consistent product
logo on your site

-  [Project Metadata](#metadata) : DOAP file checked in and up to date

- [Read PMC Branding Responsibilities](responsibility.html)

# Rationale  {#rationale}

This policy helps to promote and improve the image of all
projects that are part of the ASF, to show that all
Apache&reg; projects are part of the "community of
developers and users" that we believe is an important factor in our
success. While each of our projects manages their own affairs within the
broad guidelines of the Apache Way, a consistent public branding and web
presence that ties all of our projects together with the well-known
`www.apache.org` homepage benefits all of us by ensuring that
end users and future contributors know how to find official project resources.

Similarly, displaying Apache names and logos properly on our project pages 
helps maintain our legal rights to the trademarks they embody. 
Using the appropriate ™ and ® symbols, and using trademarks properly to 
refer to our actual software products, are key ways that we tell the 
world (and lawyers) that these trademarks are valuable to us.

**Questions?** Apache committers with questions can [contact the Trademarks Committee](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact#pmc). The [formal
Trademark Policy](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) explains
how other organizations should refer to Apache project trademarks and logos. A [list of ASF
trademarks](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/list) and
[guidelines for reporting potential misuses of trademarks](reporting.html) are also available.

**Incubator Podlings** in the Apache
Incubator have their own [detailed Podling branding
guidelines](//incubator.apache.org/guides/branding.html). Direct questions about these guidelines to the
general@incubator list. Podlings must comply with all Project Branding
Requirements *before* graduation to a top level project.

# Important Note  {#notes}

**Nothing in this ASF policy statement shall be interpreted to allow any
third party to claim any association with the Apache Software Foundation or
any of its projects or to imply any approval or support by ASF for any
third party products or services.**

This document is aimed at the ASF's internal community and the PMCs that
manage our projects, and does not override or replace our [formal Trademark
Policy](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/). If you have a question
that is not specifically answered here or that you'd like further
clarification on, please [contact us](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/contact#pmc).
