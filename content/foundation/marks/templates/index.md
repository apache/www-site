A step-by-step guide for PMC members contacting third parties potentially misusing their Apache&reg; project's trademarks.

# How To Contact Third Parties Misusing Apache Trademarks  {#howto}

You must [evaluate the *specific* context][1] of where the Apache project's name or logo is being used, 
especially with respect to what kind of product or service it's being used in conjunction with.  
Trademarks only apply within a specific class of goods - like software products, or automobiles, or 
canned food - and generally only apply to products with a similar functionality.  They also apply most 
strongly to the primary branding of a product - and not as strongly to other associated 
marketing materials. 

## Likelihood of Confusion  {#confusion}

Trademark law is about ensuring that consumers are not confused as to the source of a product, 
in our case software products.  So generally another party using our trademarks would only 
be a problem (and need to be contacted) if the two software products share somewhat similar 
functionality.  That is, it is unlikely that someone using Lucene as the name for a graphics 
editing app for phones is going to confuse users about our Lucene search engine product.

The USPTO says: "Likelihood of confusion exists between trademarks when the marks are so similar and the goods and/or services for which they are used are so related that consumers would mistakenly believe they come from the same source."

## When An Apache Project Name (e.g. "Hadoop") Is Misused  {#productname} 

- Directly as part of the name of a third party's computer software product, we must address this issue **only if** there would be a likelihood of confusion with our software product. Use the "Software Product Infringement" letter to contact the offender.

	Note that there is one exception: the proper [Powered By / For naming format][2], which is *allowed without seeking permission* as long as it is followed in scrupulous detail.

- In conjunction with / near to the name of a third party's computer software product - where the other software product has it's own name: then review the use across that company's websites.  If the *overall effect* may confuse a new user as to the source of Apache software (i.e. if a newcomer might think the third party makes that Apache software, or sponsors/controls it), then we must address this issue.

	Use "[Improper use of Apache software product brand][3]" letter.

- Directly as part of the name of a third party offering of services related to software, then we usually need to address this issue. This includes support services, training, customization, hosting / cloud / PaaS/IaaS/SaaS and similar services.

	Use the "Improper use of Apache branding with services" letter.

- In conjunction with / near to the name of a third party offering of services related to software, then we *might* need to address this issue. Review across the company's website to see what the impression a new user would have. If the *overall branding* makes it seem like that company either controls that Apache project, is a partner, allied, or affiliated with that Apache project, or is otherwise endorsed by or supported by that Apache project, then we need to address the issue.

	Use the "Improper use of Apache branding with services" letter.

- Is being used with any **non-computer related products**, then we probably do not need to address this, because 
  the ASF only makes software products, unless:

  - If they are using a name like "Apache Foo" for a non-software product, we may need to address it because we hold APACHE as a registered trademark. Contact trademarks@ for advice.


  - If they are just using the "Hadoop" part of a name for any sort of computer hardware products, we will need to address the issue **only if** the functionality that hardware provides is related to the functionality our Apache Hadoop software provides. If it is similar functionality, then work with trademarks@ to address the issue. If the functionality is different, it's most likely not a trademark issue.


  - If they are just using the "Hadoop" part of a name for any sort of product or service that is **unrelated to computers**: then we most likely do not need to address the use, unless it somehow confuses users as to where Apache software comes from. Our HADOOP registered trademark only applies to computer software, not to automobiles, printers, silverware, lawnmowing service, or housecleaning services or products.

## When An Apache Project Logo (e.g. yellow elephant) Is Misused  {#productlogo} 

- Unmodified, in direct conjunction with any third party branding for their software product or service, we probably need to address it. 

	Use "Misuse of Apache logo trademark" letter.

- Has been obviously modified, and is being used in any conjunction with any third party branding for their software product or service, we need to address it. Third parties may not modify Apache project logos to promote their own software products or services.

	Use "Misuse of Apache logo trademark" letter with added note that our logos may not be modified.


- In any other context, i.e. for hardware, physical goods, or other unrelated services, or 
  in ways that are nominative use, then we might need to address it. 

## When Apache Project Brands Are Used Elsewhere  {#projectother}

If any Apache trademarks are being used in branding of an event, please see the Third Party Event Branding Policy for more details what is allowable first.

If any Apache trademarks are being used in domain names, please see the [Third Party Domain Name Policy][4] for more details on what is allowable first.

If any Apache trademarks (names or logos) are being used on apparel or swag (or giveaways at events), please see the Merchandising Policy for more details.

## When The ASF Logo Or Apache Name Are Misused  {#logo}

The ASF logo and APACHE&reg; name are a key part of the brand for all projects as well as the 
ASF as a whole.  Misuses of these brands are serious matters that should always be brought to the 
[attention of trademarks@][5] directly, where we will determine the appropriate action to take.

As a public charity, we are happy when other parties talk about Apache projects or the ASF, as long 
as they are making factual statements, and are not claiming any affiliation, partnership, or other 
relationship to the ASF.  There are a few factual exceptions, for example paid Sponsors of the 
ASF and factual statements from companies that have successfully donated podlings to the Incubator.
