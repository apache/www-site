for trademark use by both *outside parties*, and by *Apache PMCs*.  Items
marked MUST are required; items marked SHOULD or MAY are best practices
or guidelines for usage.  A [site map of trademark resources][resources] is available, 
and you can [contact us][contact] with questions.

## Policies For Outside Parties  {#outside}

- If you are acting on behalf of any entity except the ASF or an 
Apache project, the [formal trademark policy][policy] defines the
allowable uses of Apache trademarks, which include all Apache 
project names and logos, along with our APACHE&reg; house mark and 
the stylized feather logo.

- You may request permission to use Apache trademarks in conjunction with
[conferences or events][events], or in [domain names][domains], but
you must first follow our detailed policies.

- Please see the [Apache Product Name Usage Guide][guide] for a 
detailed description of how to refer to Apache product names in your work. 

- Our [FAQ][faq] provides many common answers to "Can I do *this* with an Apache trademark?".

## Policies For Apache Projects  {#pmcs}

Apache projects may define their own brand - name, logo, style - and
promote it in their own way.  To ensure the ASF's ability to defend
our project trademarks, there are a few MUST requirements for how
projects display their websites and how they deal with reported
misuses of their trademarks.  There are also a number of SHOULD best practices that
PMCs may find useful as well.

### Apache Project Names  {#name}

- Must be [named "Apache *Project*"](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#websites).
- New software product names must use the [Name Search process][naming]
(primarily to ensure they do not conflict with existing trademarks).
- PMCs should consider [requesting registration][register] of their project name.

### Apache Project Logos  {#logo}

- May [include a version of the Apache feather](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#graphics).

### Apache Project Websites  {#website}

- Must host the [primary development website at *projectname*.apache.org](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#websites).
- Must have a few defined [links back to the ASF](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#navigation) in their navigation structure.
- Must use the [appropriate &trade; or &reg; symbol](//www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#attributions)
to legally note their name is a trademark, and provide an attribution on the homepage.
- Should use appropriate [names for social media accounts][socialmedia].
- Should link to other [corporations' websites appropriately][linking].

### Apache Project Governance  {#governance}

- PMCs must [govern their projects independently][independent] for the benefit of the 
whole project community, and not favoring any outside organizations.

### Apache PMCs and Outside Parties  {#requests}

- PMCs must [evaluate and address misuses][reporting] of their own trademarks
that are reported to them.
- PMCs should respond to [event][events] and [domain][domains] name requests
by outside parties - if not, they must ask trademarks@ to handle those requests.
- PMCs may [always ask for assistance][contact] on trademarks@.
