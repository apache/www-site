categorized by audience - i.e. are you an Apache PMC member or committer working *within*
an Apache project, or are you a user, new contributor, software vendor, or third party?

## Other Useful Trademark Information  {#other}

Trademark law is a complicated subject, varying by country.  Free and open source software projects - often
developed by a broad collection of volunteers, and often copied/improved upon or used for services - sometimes
struggle with properly using and enforcing their trademarks, especially in the face of sometimes fierce and
fast-moving commercial companies looking to profit from this work.

Here are a number of *external links* that you may find useful in learning about trademark law and how trademarks apply to FOSS software like our many Apache software projects.

## Selected Trademark Search Websites  {#search}

While many Apache software product names are unregistered trademarks, more and more Apache project
communities are choosing to register their product name in the US and/or other countries.  These *external links*
are just a few of the sites you might use to search for legally registered trademarks.  Pro tip: The <a href="https://www.upcounsel.com/trademark-class-9" target="_blank">Nice Class 9</a> is used
for most software-related trademarks.

 * [USPTO Trademark Search Database](http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database) - official
US trademark registry.  Tip: when copying links about specific registrations/applications, do **not** use the search link you get - copy
the "TDSR" blue button link instead.  There are many [more USPTO search tips](/foundation/marks/naming#research-registered-trademarks).
 * [TMView search by OHIM](https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/welcome) - Official search tool for trademarks covering the EU/CTM and parts of Europe.
 * [India Office of Trademarks](http://ipindia.nic.in/tmr_new/default.htm) - official trademark registry of India.
 * [China Trademark Office](http://www.chinatrademarkoffice.com/) - government sanctioned search company for trademarks in China.
 * [Canadian Intellectual Property Office ](http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/tmSrch.do?lang=eng) - official trademark registry of Canada.
