# Are Apache&reg; project names and logos trademarks?  {#obvious}

Yes, the names of all Apache&reg; projects, software products, and their logos are trademarks 
that the Apache Software Foundation owns on behalf of our project communities.  Note that 
while some Apache project names and logos are registered in the US and various countries, even unregistered names and logos 
are still trademarks of the ASF and should be treated with respect.

# How should I refer to Apache software product names?  {#guide}

Apache project names have the form "Apache *Projectname*", for 
example Apache Hadoop&reg; and Apache OpenOffice&reg;.  Read our 
[detailed guide for referring to Apache project and product names](/foundation/marks/guide).
Using the full "Apache *Projectname*" helps ensure that our volunteer 
project communities get the credit they deserve.

# How should I provide attributions of Apache marks?  {#attribution}

To properly attribute Apache marks, and to ensure that the volunteer 
communities that build Apache software get the credit they deserve, 
place prominent trademark attributions wherever you use Apache marks.  On websites, add hyperlinks to the relevant 
project homepage and to the ASF.  For example, to 
provide an attribution for Apache Hadoop and its yellow elephant logo
(using basic HTML with hyperlinks):  

>   Apache&reg;, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop, Hadoop&reg;</a>, 
   and the yellow elephant logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks 
   of the <a href="/">Apache Software Foundation</a>
   in the United States and/or other countries.

In text, use Apache Lucene&reg; in the first and most prominent uses because it is a registered trademark; 
some other Apache project names like Apache Zookeeper&trade; are unregistered 
but are still considered trademarks of the ASF.

Here is a complete [list of trademarks claimed by the ASF][1].

# May I use Apache marks in the title or cover of published books?  {#booktitle}

In general, yes, as long as you comply with the rest of Apache trademark 
policies, in particular in regard to not claiming association or endorsement 
of/for/by the ASF.  For more details or for explicit permissions, [contact us][contact].

- The ASF generally requires that you refer to Apache products using the 
full "Apache Tomcat&reg;" form of its name, especially in prominent places like 
book titles.  However, we do understand that some publishing houses may 
have specific standards for book titles that prevent this for 
traditionally printed and bound books.  In that case, and only for traditionally 
printed and bound books, 
using the bare product name as "Tomcat&reg;" is acceptable as long as there is 
clear attribution of both forms of the name.  
  
- You must include a trademark attribution on the obverse title page or 
wherever you acknowledge other trademarks and copyrights.  A 
preferred attribution would be: 

>   Apache&reg;, Apache Tomcat, Tomcat&reg;</a>, 
   and the cat logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks 
   of the <a href="/">Apache Software Foundation</a>
   in the United States and/or other countries. No endorsement by 
   The Apache Software Foundation is implied by the use of these marks.

- You may not use the title or presentation of the book's cover, front matter, or other 
contents to imply association with, endorsement of/by, or 
any other exclusive or special connection with the ASF or the project's 
community or product.

- We do not require the payment of a royalty for the use of Apache marks or other IP in 
regularly published books.  We certainly do appreciate royalty donations, 
and a number of publishers have set up systems to donate royalties from their 
books back to the ASF.  You can read more about [Donating to the 
ASF](/foundation/contributing.html).


# May I display Apache product logos on my website or marketing materials for ASF software products that my organization's software integrates with or supports?  {#integrateswith}

Yes, as long as you follow the rest of our [formal Trademark 
Policy](/foundation/marks/).  Note that you may [not use 
Apache product word marks](#products) as part of any software product name.
In particular, you must ensure that you follow our [Apache name usage guide][2] and: 

- Use the unmodified ASF product logo made available for this purpose on
the Apache website or on the ASF project's homepage. If you do not find the
ASF product logo you want in that collection, ask the ASF project team to
add it there.

- If you describe the ASF product or project in text, use the "Apache Flink&reg;"
form of its name.

- Do not visually combine the ASF product logo with any other images, and 
   do not change the appearance of ASF product logos except in cases where 
   it is **required** by a specific printing restriction (e.g. printing on paper in black and white).

- On your website link any Apache project logo to the homepage for that Apache project on
the apache.org website.

- Include a trademark attribution to Apache Software Foundation in an
appropriate place on every page where you identify your own trademarks.

- Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not imply ASF
endorsement or the affiliation of your products, services, or organization
with ASF.

- Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not confuse the
average user about the source of ASF products or imply that ASF is
associated with your products or services in any way.

# May I use Apache marks (names, logos) in software product names?  {#products}

No, you may **not** use Apache trademarks - the names of any project or software product releases from the ASF -
 in the primary or secondary branding of
any third party product or service names.  For example, you may **not** name a product either "BigCo *Project* Thing", "BigCo distribution of *Project*", 
or any similar kind of name where *Project* is any Apache mark or project name.

The primary mission of the ASF is to provide free software for the public 
good under our Apache License. Consumer confusion over the source 
of Apache software products is a serious issue for the ASF.  Both for consumers trying 
to find Apache products, and for the communities and PMCs that build our 
products, the name and logo association of Apache marks with our actual 
project communities and products is important to us.

We understand the importance in our ecosystem of third parties building 
software products on or in conjunction with Apache products.  If you 
build such software products, see the [next question about our 
"Powered by..." program](#poweredby).  


# May I distibute modified versions of Apache Software under the original name?

Generally, no. If you distribute modified versions of Apache Software you must
do so under a new name. There are limited circumstance where this is permitted
which are set out in the [Apache Downstream Distribution Policy][downstream].


# May I use Apache Powered by... marks or logos in software product names or logos?  {#poweredby}  

Yes, under certain circumstances, you may use the Powered by... phrase or 
a project-specific [Powered by... logo][3] in direct conjunction with your 
software product or service's primary branding.  This applies for all
Apache project names and the Powered By... variation (inside a circle with 
Powered By Apache around the outside) of their logos. 

- Third parties providing products or services that are supersets of the 
functionality of an Apache product, or services that run atop Apache products, 
may use any "Powered by..." form of the Apache brand name of the related 
product.  For example, "BigCo SuperThing, Powered by Apache Spark" would be 
acceptable, provided that you meet **all** of the other requirements:

    - Any primary product home pages or landing pages for the SuperThing product must include a 
    link from the homepage named "Apache *Spark*" pointing to the actual Apache 
    project home page at http://*spark*.apache.org/  Note that you **must** include 
    "Apache" before the product mark.

    - You product name **must** consistently use the "Apache Spark" version of the Apache 
    product name and follow the [Apache *Project* brand usage guide][guide].

    - Do not visually combine the ASF product's Powered by... logo with any 
    other images, or change the logo in any way other than ways **required** by printing restrictions.

    - On your website link any Powered by... logo to the homepage for 
    the ASF project on the apache.org website.

    - Include a [trademark attribution](#attribution) to the Apache Software Foundation 
    on the page itself (footers are acceptable; links with attributions on separate pages are **not**).

    - Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not imply ASF
    endorsement or the affiliation of your products, services, or organization
    with ASF.

    - Ensure that your website and marketing materials do not confuse the
    average user about the source of ASF products or imply that ASF is
    associated with your products or services in any way, other than the 
    fact that your product is built atop/to work with the Apache product.

- See also the [Apache *Project* brand usage guide][guide] for more requirements.


Various Apache projects include a "Powered by..."-specific logo for 
their product(s).  If the product you are interested in doesn't provide 
a Powered by... logo, ask the relevant PMC to consider creating one.  

**NOTE:** Use of an Apache product's normal logo (i.e. the *non* Powered-by) is 
**not** permissible to directly denote products or services, even those 
built atop an Apache product.  You must not visually combine or directly associate Apache products' normal logos with third-party product logos.

See also the [Powered By Apache logo](/foundation/press/kit/)
page for details about logo usage.


# May I use The ASF logo on the cover/title of published books, articles, or other publications?  {#titlefeather}

No.  The ASF logo is a special trademark to the members of The Apache
Software Foundation.  You may **not** use the logo on the external covers or title pages 
of books or similar printed materials. 


# May I use Apache product logos on the cover/title of published books, articles, or other publications?  {#titlelogo}

Use of Apache project logos on the external cover or title pages of books or 
similar printed materials is allowed only with permission; to request 
this, [contact us][contact] with a mockup of the cover and other details about your 
publication.

We understand the importance in our ecosystem of authors publishing 
informational books about Apache products, and the value that can bring 
in terms of new contributors to our communities.  However, you must take care to use Apache product logos in descriptive ways, without 
implying any association or endorsement, and without implying that 
your book is an official or sole source of information about any 
Apache product.


# May I use Apache marks, screenshots, or program output within published books, articles, or other publications?  {#insidebook}

In general, yes, as long as you comply with the rest of the Apache trademark 
policies, in particular in regard to not claiming association or endorsement 
of/for/by the ASF.  For more details or for explicit permissions when legally required, [contact us][contact].

- The ASF prefers that you refer to Apache products using the 
full "Apache *Ignite*" form of the product name, at least in the first or most 
prominent uses within a book, chapter, article, or other section 
of a larger published work; see the [Apache *Project* brand usage guide][guide] for details.

- You may use screenshots, program output, and other displays created by or taken 
of Apache products in use in descriptive ways in the 
content of publications.  Such use may include Apache product logos 
as they normally display in the product in question.  
  
- You must include a trademark attribution on the obverse title page or 
wherever you acknowledge other trademarks and copyrights.  A 
preferred attribution would be:

>   Apache&reg;, Apache Ignite, Ignite</a>, 
   and the flame logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks 
   of the Apache Software Foundation
   in the United States and/or other countries. No endorsement by 
   The Apache Software Foundation is implied by the use of these marks.

- ASF does not require royalties for the use of Apache marks or other IP in 
regularly-published books.  We certainly do appreciate non-targeted donations, 
and a number of publishers have set up systems to donate all or part of the royalties from their 
books to the ASF.  Read more about [Donating to the 
ASF](/foundation/contributing.html).


# May I use Apache marks, screenshots, or program output in academic papers, articles, or similar non-profit scholarly publications?  {#insideuniv}

Yes, as long as you comply with the rest of Apache trademark 
policies, in particular in regard to not claiming association or endorsement 
of/for/by the ASF.  For more details or for explicit permissions when legally required, [contact us][contact].

As long as uses of Apache trademarks or logos are clear in referring to the software 
products produced by the ASF, the ASF position is that this FAQ should constitute sufficient 
permissions for non-profit academic and scholarly papers and publications to use 
our trademarks in all respectful ways.  We appreciate the researchers and students 
who want to use Apache software products to further human knowledge. 


# Should we donate project trademarks along with the code when we submit to the Apache Incubator?  {#incubator}

That depends on your goals.  Many groups donate existing projects to the 
[Apache Incubator][incubator], to become podlings and, we hope eventually become official Apache top level
projects (TLPs).  When you have an existing project that has a well-known brand 
and associated trademarks or registrations, the **donor** needs to decide if they 
also wish to donate all trademarks with the project, or if they will keep the 
trademarks, and have the new podling choose a new name and brand.  For a podling to graduate and become a TLP, 
the ASF must own all trademark rights to the podling's brand.

- If you donate the brand with the project, the ASF must have full legal ownership 
of all brand elements before graduation.  It becomes an Apache brand, and the 
donor will not be allowed to claim any special relationship with the trademarks going forward.

- If you keep the brand, the podling will need to choose a new name as it starts the incubation process.  This allows you to keep the goodwill from your 
existing brand, but means that the podling will likely have to work harder to grow 
the diverse community that the Incubation process is designed to show.


# How do we transfer trademark rights when submitting a project to the Apache Incubator  {#podlingxfer}

One of the *graduation* criteria for podlings to TLP status is that the ASF own **all** trademark rights 
and goodwill to the podling's brand.  Since the incubation process takes a number of 
months, the recommended way to transfer trademarks and any pre-existing registrations is:

- In the incubation proposal, explicitly note that the donor organization is planning 
to donate all trademarks and goodwill.  Include a list of all trademarks, 
especially any registrations or applications outstanding. 

- After the ASF accepts the podling for incubation, has imported the code, and 
published a website, have an officer of the donating organization [contact us][contact]
via email to explicitly state that you will be transferring all trademarks.  This gives 
the ASF assurance of the transfer, but does not require the donor to legally assign 
the trademarks until the podling nears graduation.  Also, list the trademarks and donor 
organization in the [PODLINGNAMESEARCH][podlingnamesearch] when that issue is 
created as part of the incubation process.

- Before the podling is ready to graduate, have donor counsel [contact us][contact] 
to sign a standard trademark transfer agreement in the US, where the ASF is 
headquartered.  As the ASF is a non-profit, we appreciate any assistance in processing the transfer, especially 
of applications in process.  The legal transfer must be signed before 
the podling can formally graduate, typically at a monthly board meeting.

- **IMPORTANT:** If you are considering submitting a new registration application 
*during the incubation process*, you **must** coordinate with VP, Brand and ASF counsel.

# Can I refer to an individual or organization as the "founder" or "creator" of an ASF project? {#creator}

The ASF discourages this because it is detrimental to the long-term health of a project community to continually call attention to the individuals and/or organizations that originally created the project.

If it is necessary to highlight individuals and companies who founded a project that is now under the ASF's stewardship, they may be referred to as "original creator of Apache Project Name" or "original developer of Apache Project Name."

Usage guidelines:

- If the claim is accurate, for the first two years after the open source project becomes a Top Level Project it is acceptable to use the following terms on your marketing materials: creator(s); original creator(s); original developer(s).
- If your project is two years or older, ASF Marketing & Publicity will no longer approve those or similar terms in timely materials such as press releases; however, the terms may still appear in historical materials such as your website's About page or Wikipedia.
