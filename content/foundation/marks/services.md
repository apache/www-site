Title: Third Party Services Naming Branding Policy
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

# {{title}}

This **Services Naming Branding Policy** defines **requirements** for when third 
parties may be eligible to request permission to use 
Apache&reg; marks in their *service* names (i.e. services that provide
hosted versions or implementations of Apache products, or services directly 
related to Apache products), and the process to request permission from an officer of the ASF.

## DRAFT DOCUMENT  {#DRAFT}

**This document is an UNOFFICIAL DRAFT and should not be considered 
official policy.  Substantial changes may be made before being published 
as an official policy.  Direct any questions to trademarks@apache.org.**

## Services Naming Branding Overview  {#introduction}

**In general, you may not use Apache marks such as "Apache *Project*" or 
"*Project*" as primary branding in your services names or service marks** if 
that use would likely confuse a relevant consumer about the source any 
software or services you provide with products or services provided by 
the Apache *Project* project or the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) as a whole.  You
should apply the "likelihood of confusion" test described in our 
[formal Trademark Policy](/foundation/marks/), 
understanding that the use of Apache marks in third party services is 
generally not "nominative fair use."

You may be eligible to [Request Permission to Use Apache marks](#permission) related to 
our products in the primary branding of your service if the naming style 
and presentation of your service to the public meets our services naming 
requirements below.  Thus in some cases a website providing a hosted set of 
Apache Solr search tools and search indexes as a service to the public
may be granted permission to use a service branding like *QuickFind using 
Apache Solr* if you get specific permission from the VP, Brand Management 
and/or the VP of the relevant Apache project (Apache Lucene in this case).

Note that this does not generally apply to our "Apache" trademark; use of that 
mark in services names that may be confusingly similar to any Apache project or 
product or service is **not** allowed.  The Apache brand is important to all 
Apache projects, and is special to our organization, as well as being the 
primary way that consumers discover our projects and products.

## Do Not Promote Similar Services Offered By Apache  {#nonproduct}

Services names using Apache marks must not be used to promote or provide 
services that either the Apache project itself or the ASF 
as a whole provides.  For example, providing issue trackers, mailing lists, 
or download facilities for software products are all services that Apache
projects offer; hence third parties may not brand similar services using 
Apache marks.  

**Exception:** you may be eligible to provide a hosted service 
version of an Apache software product that provides these kinds of 
services to the public.  That is, you could provide a hosted service 
called *FindMail, Powered By Apache Pony Mail*, that provides mailing 
list services to the general public or to your customers, because that is 
the general functionality of Apache Pony Mail.

The Apache brand overall represents a broad array of core services offered 
to both developers and users of our products, covering user support, source 
code control, and a variety of other project-related metrics.  Ensuring that 
relevant consumers come directly to Apache to utilize our development-related services when they 
are interested in learning about or using our products is important to us.   

## Must Clearly Display Non-Affiliation  {#nonaffiliation}

Website content and services branding must clearly and prominently inform 
the public that the service and your organization are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or otherwise 
associated with the ASF or any of its projects.

This must include an appropriate statement specifying non-affiliation in the main 
text body of your About or similar explanatory page of your website, or 
similar Help - About dialog or other method of user help, as well 
as being included in at least the footer of 
the main landing page for any associated website or other commonly used footer 
or appendix for your service.  Depending on the type of content for your 
website, we may also require a prominent non-affiliation notice within the 
text of the main landing page itself or the service's splash page, as appropriate.

## Must Provide Credit To Relevant Apache Project Community  {#credit}

The primary landing page of the domain's website, and any "About", "Contact", 
or similarly named page(s) or features of your service must provide a 
prominent text credit and link to the Apache project whose mark is being 
used, as well as a mention of the independent community behind the project.  
A common motto of Apache projects is "Community over code", and prominent 
uses of Apache marks must clearly provide credit to the community behind 
the mark and its product.

## Must Include Links To Relevant Apache Product Resources  {#resources}

A website promoting your service must include a prominent section or 
page named "Resources", "More Information", "Links", or some other 
appropriate title that features hypertext links to the mailing lists 
and other services that the relevant Apache project itself provides.  This 
must include at least a link to the homepage of the Apache project, 
as well as a link to the Apache project's mailing lists, plus a brief 
description of these resources.  Depending on the delivery method of your 
service, this requirement may be met in a variety of ways.

You may contact the relevant Apache project to get a listing of appropriate links 
to include.  The use of freely available, publicly archived mailing lists 
and other support tools are a critical part of any Apache project, and ensuring 
that links to our mailing lists are provided freely is a benefit both to 
Apache projects and our users.  This ensures that users of your service 
have an opportunity to learn how to report bugs or suggestions to the 
Apache project you are using.

## Non-Disparaging References To Apache Projects  {#positive}

Service names using Apache marks must not be used to disparage the reputation 
of the ASF, its projects, products, or communities.
Factual comparisons of Apache software versus other software are appropriate 
as long as they are not used in a misleading way.

As a non-profit devoted to the public good through the software that we 
produce, it is inappropriate for us to provide permission for third parties 
to use our marks to disparage our communities or our work.

## No Exclusive Or Controlling Relationship  {#exclusive}

Services names using Apache marks must not give the impression 
to relevant consumers that the organization controlling or providing the 
service has an 
exclusive or controlling relationship with any Apache project or with the 
ASF as a whole, or with any service related to our products.

For example, a website declaring itself "The Only Host For Apache *Project*" would 
not be permitted since it implies an exclusive resource.  Likewise, branding 
or taglines such as "The Apache *Project* Project Leaders" are not allowed, since 
that implies control of the *Project* project.

Users of Apache marks in third party services must acknowledge that Apache projects 
are solely managed by the Project Management Committee (PMC) of the project, 
and not by any single individual nor by (even partly or indirectly) any 
third party organization.  Similarly, service names using 
Apache marks that state or imply that that organization has an exclusive or 
sole relationship to any Apache project would both be factually incorrect, as 
well as harmful to the Apache project's community, and are not allowed.  

## Trademark Attributions And Proper Apache Brand Usage  {#attributions}

Any use of Apache trademarks on any pages of the service must comply with
our trademark policy and follow our [Apache Product Name Usage Guide][guide].

The primary splash page or user help for the service, and any "Legal", "About", "Disclaimer", 
or similarly named pages or services must feature prominent attributions of all Apache 
marks used on the domain. For example:

>Apache *Project*, *Project* and Apache are either registered trademarks or trademarks of
the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries,
and are used with permission as of 2017. The Apache Software Foundation has
no affiliation with and does not endorse or review the materials provided at
this website, which is managed by *YourBigCo*.

This may appear in page footers or in any other appropriate location. The
"Apache Software Foundation" text should link to http://www.apache.org/ and
the "used with permission" should link to this Services Name Branding Requirements
page.  Note that you **must** have a current written permission from the 
VP, Brand Management or the VP of the relevant Apache project to include the 
"used with permission" phrase.

## Logos And Graphics Usage  {#graphics}

Third party websites may not use any Apache logos or graphics as part of their 
service branding. Apache product logos may only be used to refer to the
Apache products or projects themselves, must be clearly set off from 
any of the domain's own branding and logos, and must include a hyperlink to 
the Apache project's home page where practicable.  You must not change the 
appearance of any Apache logos when using them.

Third party website branding may not include the Apache feather as a brand 
element in any way. The only use of the bare Apache feather or Apache logo 
on websites allowed is to provide a single link to http://www.apache.org/ 
as a reference to The Apache Software Foundation and its projects.

## Must Not Use "Apache" And "ApacheCon" Names  {#apachecon}

Third parties may not use either the "Apache" nor the "ApacheCon"
names, nor confusingly similar names, in their service names as a primary 
branding feature. These names 
are reserved exclusively for the ASF, its projects, and its
own authorized conferences.

## How To: Request Permission For Services  {#permission} 

If you have a service created or in development that you wish to provide to 
the public incorporating any Apache marks in its branding, please 
[email us on the trademarks@](mailto:trademarks@apache.org?subject=%5btrademark%5d%20Service%20name%20approval%20for)
mailing list.

Please feel free to contact us in advance of setting up your service with your 
proposed name and an overview of what any related website or other user materials
will be designed for and a mockup of your site content so that we can start 
the discussion.  Note that any permissions granted are contingent on the 
service name and branding remaining in compliance with this policy.

## Rationale  {#rationale}

The primary mission of the Apache Software Foundation is to provide software 
products for the public good.  Equally important is The Apache Way, or the 
community-led, consensus-driven, and public mailing list methods that our 
many projects use to produce the software products that we provide to the 
public.  Thus these branding guidelines are different from those used for software 
**products**, because software products are the key value that Apache projects 
provide for the public.   

The fundamental driver for Apache projects are the communities and PMCs that 
contribute to and run those projects.  As an all-volunteer organization, 
maintaining the health of the **community** of committers within a project 
is critical to Apache and to the project.  Thus it is important for any 
third party uses of our marks to properly credit the community behind 
the project whose mark they are using. 
 
As a non-profit organization whose mission is to serve the public good, our 
projects also provide a number of support services for the products that 
they produce.  This is both a useful and free resource for the public, but 
is also an integral part of The Apache Way, and is important to the health 
of our communities.  Thus ensuring that third parties provide appropriate links 
to the free support services and mailing lists that our projects provide is 
important both to our communities themselves, and to the public who 
may wish to use Apache products.  Obviously, third parties that primarily 
disparage our communities or products are not welcome to use our marks in 
ways that might be infringing.

The ASF provides a core set of services both for 
the communities that drive our projects, as well as for end users of our 
products.  Ensuring that end users can easily learn about and come to the 
Apache hosted versions of these services - including but not limited to 
issue tracking, mailing lists, website documentation and download services 
- is important to our project communities and to the ASF itself. 

Apache projects are run solely by their PMCs, as projects independent of 
outside corporations or organizations.  It is important to maintain both 
the actual independence of our PMCs from third parties, as well as to ensure 
that third parties do not use our marks to imply controlling, exclusive, 
or otherwise exclusionary relationships to our PMCs, projects, or communities. 

Similarly, as an all-volunteer organization, our projects may sometimes be 
limited in the level or frequency of support or other services that they 
may offer to the public.  There are many third parties who have the ability 
to provide valuable additional services or products related 
to Apache products.  Having reputable third parties offering hosted services, 
support contracts, consulting and training, and other services related to our 
products is a benefit to the public who uses our products, and often can be 
a benefit to the long term health of our project communities - as long as 
the public using those services is properly informed of the source of the 
Apache software products, and the communities behind them, that are 
powering those services.   

Thus while Apache must strongly protect its marks as applied to software products - the 
primary value we provide to the public - we have established these requirements 
to encourage reputable third parties to consider responsibly offering services 
or websites that may be branded using Apache marks in respectful ways.
