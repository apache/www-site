# ASF Leadership

The Foundation itself is a collaborative project of the Apache Software Foundation, which means our leadership is elected by Members and maintains its own governance. Our leadership is composed entirely of volunteers who are committed to advancing ASFâ€™s mission of providing software for the public good.
