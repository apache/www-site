This page answers most of the common queries that we receive as email about our
Apache&reg; projects' software and the Apache Software Foundation(ASF) as a non-profit organization. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** If you send us email about something that **is** clearly
covered by the information on this page, we will probably ignore your email. Please accept our apologies for such an impersonal response, but
with several million users and not that many volunteers to respond to queries, we cannot provide personalised email support.

1. **You unexpectedly see an Apache HTTP
   Server installation page when you visit a Web site.** 
   If you have sent us mail because you saw a page saying 'It Worked!' (or
   something similar indicating that the Apache HTTP server has been installed) on your screen
   when you visit a web site, go back and **READ** the page. It should
   explain what is going on. The page is the equivalent of a demo or the
   ReadMe file from a Windows application installation; it is intended for the
   person who installed the software and is supposed to show that the
   installation completed successfully. The problem you are experiencing
   has nothing to do with us, and we cannot help you. You need to contact the
   Webmaster for the site. If the site is www.foo.com, for instance, try
   sending mail to `webmaster@foo.com`. If it's www.toddsbeer.org, send
   mail to `webmaster@toddsbeer.org`. And so on.
   
   Some older versions of the 'It Worked!' page (supplied with older versions of the software)
   don't say that, or are mysterious or ambiguous. What they _should_ say, and what the recent
   versions say, is something like this!

        It Worked! The Apache Web Server is installed on this Web Site!
        ---
        If you can see this page, then the people who own this
        domain have just installed the Apache Web server software
        successfully. They now have to add content to this directory
        and replace this placeholder page, or else point the server
        at their real content.
        ---
        If you are seeing this page instead of the site you expected,
        please contact the administrator of the site involved. (Try
        sending mail to <Webmaster@domain> Although this site is
        running the Apache software it almost certainly has no other
        connection to the Apache Group, so please do not send mail
        about this site or its contents to the Apache authors. If you
        do, your message will be ignored.

   <a id="mypc" name="mypc"></a>

2. **You see an Apache HTTP Server installation
   message on your own computer.**
   If you think that the Apache HTTP Server software has somehow been
   installed on your PC or laptop, don't worry: **IT HASN'T**. The page you
   are seeing is from a remote Web site which has installed our software and
   which you have visited. See [above](#itworked) for an
   explanation.

   <a id="intruder" name="intruder"></a>

1. **Your security software reported an intrusion.**
   If you sent your message because your intrusion detection reported an
   attack on your system and you clicked on the name or IP address of the
   attacking system, please use the whois (if it reported a name) or the ARIN
   (if it reported an address) databases to locate the actual owner of the
   system. These databases are the authoritative ones for the Internet. See the
   [links to them](#dirs) at the end of this page.

   <a id="hijack" name="hijack"></a>

1. **You think Apache has stolen or hijacked one of your favourite Web sites.**
   If you think that Apache has somehow 'hijacked,' 'taken over,' or otherwise
   blocked access to a Web site, **IT HASN'T**. The people who actually
   *run* the Web site have installed or upgraded the Apache software which
   answers browser requests, and haven't completed the upgrade yet. See
   [paragraph [1]](#itworked) above for suggestions on how to reach them for a
   status update.

   <a id="spam" name="spam"></a>

1. **You're tracing spam.**
   If you have sent us mail because you think you have traced spam to a system
   that displays the 'It Worked!' page, or another page indicating that Apache
   is running on the system, the same advice applies: it is **not** our
   system; they are just using Web software we develop and distribute for
   free. The Web software has nothing to do with email or spam, it's just
   running on the same system. Apache has as much to do with email as Tetris
   does, and assuming we're responsible in any way for the spam is as
   reasonable as blaming Microsoft and Microsoft Excel because someone used
   Netscape to send you a nasty message. We are not and can not be responsible
   for their activity. See the [last set of URLs](#dirs) below for Internet
   databases that will help you find out who actually owns the systems,
   domains, and/or IP addresses involved.

   <a id="licence" name="licence"></a><a id="license" name="license"></a> <!-- N.B. keep the old spelling to avoid breaking links -->

1. **You have questions about the Apache license.**
   If you have sent mail about a license issue or question, please review the
   [online license](/LICENSE) at the URL listed below.
   The gist of the license is that you may use, modify, and [re]distribute
   the Apache software as-is. As long as you do not change the software, you
   may re-distribute it and call it "Apache." If you alter the software in any
   way, other than tailoring the configuration files or making it compilable
   on your platform, you may only refer to it as being based upon Apache. In
   all cases, altered or not, you must include attribution as described in
   section 3 of the license. If you have further questions, see our [license
   FAQ](license-faq.html). If that doesn't answer them, you may contact our
   [Legal Affairs Committee](/legal/).

   <a name="export"></a>

1. **You have questions about Apache software and U.S. export control numbers (ECCNs).**
   Please consult our [detailed information on the export control status of
   The Apache Software Foundation's products](/licenses/exports/).

        If a vendor is choosing to distribute ASF software, it is their
        responsibility to get whatever licenses or other blessings they need for
        their application. Consult your own IP/export attorney
        for further advice.

   <a name="purchase"></a>

1. **You have questions about purchasing Apache software or obtaining support for it.**
   All software produced by the Foundation is available for download, by
   anyone and for free, from our Web sites and mirrors. We do not sell it; we
   give it away. Neither do we provide formal or commercial support for any of
   our packages.

   Also see the [is it free](license-faq.html#IsItFree) and following
   sections in our license FAQ and our [Apache software is free of cost](/free/) page.

   <a id="projects" name="projects"></a>

1. **You have questions about other Apache projects.**
   Use the project's website, or find it through the [project
   directory](http://projects.apache.org/) to find the project's mailing list.
   Address technical questions to the appropriate
   project's mailing list, and not to any of the general e-mail addresses of the
   ASF.

   <a id="incubator" name="incubator"></a>

1. **You have a community/codebase that you would like to bring to the ASF.**
   The [Apache Incubator](//incubator.apache.org/) is where new 
   community [project proposals](//incubator.apache.org/guides/proposal.html) come to see if they could be a fit for Apache.

   <a id="patch" name="patch"></a>

1. **You have issues, bug reports, patches for a particular project.**
   Each Apache project uses an issue tracker dedicated to their project. The
   best way is to go via that project's web pages. If you still have trouble
   finding it, try finding the project at
   [projects.apache.org](http://projects.apache.org/) or by browsing
   [issues.apache.org](http://issues.apache.org/).

   <a id="dirs" name="dirs"></a>

1. **Domain ownership lookup/IP address tracing**
   How to: Look up the owner of a domain<small>(such as foo.com)</small>:
   [http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois](http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois)
   &gt;
   WHOIS database (tells you who owns a domain, such as foo.com).

    - How to: Look up the owner of an IP address<small>(such as
      10.0.35.147):</small>:<br></br> [https://ws.arin.net/whois/](https://ws.arin.net/whois/).
      ARIN (Registered Internet Numbers) database (tells you who owns an IP
      address, such as 10.0.35.147, or which other database to query if the
      address is assigned outside the USA)

   <a id="brand" name="brand"></a>

1. **You have a question about Apache trademarks, or you want to know if a use of
   an Apache trademark is related to the ASF**
   You may read our [formal Trademark Policy](/foundation/marks/) as an
   introduction. For any questions about the use of Apache marks, including logos
   and project or product names, or the Apache name or feather, contact the
   [Brand Management Committee](/foundation/marks/contact) as well as to the relevant [Project
   Management Committee](//projects.apache.org/).
