# Corporate Giving Programs  {#CorporateGiving}

The impact of your gift to the ASF as part of an annual giving program helps boost the all-volunteer Foundationâ€™s ability to continue developing, shepherding, and incubating Open Source projects. Remember: all Apache products are available to the public 100% free of charge!

Companies that offer matching gifts not only receive tax benefits, but also provide their employees the ability to bolster their support of a diverse set of nonprofit organizations.

If your employer has a matching gift program, your contribution to the ASF can be generously increased and will help even more to support its mission. The ASF's tax identification number is 47-0825376. For more information, please contact us at *fundraising at apache dot org*.

The ASF is also listed as an official charity in the Benevity Causes Portal as part of numerous corporate giving initiatives, such as the Microsoft Tech Talent for Good volunteer program, among others. For more information, visit <a href=https://www.benevity.com/target=_blank>https://www.benevity.com/</a>.

Those organizations and individuals seeking to increase their support further may also wish to become an <a href=/foundation/sponsorship.html>ASF Sponsor</a>.

# Why should I donate?  {#WhyDonate}

The Apache Software Foundation provides the infrastructure to support the
development efforts of more than 150 Open Source projects. This includes
mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, web servers,
continuous integration servers, and so on. There's a significant financial
cost associated with providing these services, both in infrastructure costs -
bandwidth, electricity, cooling, and so on - and in paying the administrative
staff that do the day-to-day maintenance of the services.

Donations, both from individuals and corporations, are the only way that we
have to offset these costs.

Remember, of course, that as a volunteer-based organization, the Apache Software
Foundation stands most in need of volunteers who can work on software,
documentation, or administrative tasks within each of the [ASF
projects](https://projects.apache.org/indexes/quick.html). If you have the 
available time to contribute, then that's the best thing you can give - 
volunteer contributions from both individuals and corporate entities are 
the lifeblood of the foundation.

# Where would my donations go?  {#Financial}

Currently, the bulk of our financial obligations are going towards
providing our technical infrastructure - the staff, servers and bandwidth
that are required. The foundation also provides legal support for our
projects, therefore, it is often required to obtain qualified legal counsel
about issues that arise. Other costs include marketing, trademark policing,
and the paperwork of running a non-profit foundation.

If you have a specific target or project that you wish to directly support,
please [contact us](#Fundraising) and we will do our best to satisfy your
wishes.

If you wish to provide equipment for use by the Foundation, please [contact
us](#Fundraising) before attempting to send it "here" directly -- the
nature of our virtual enterprise is such that the equipment and services
used to support our projects are located all over the world.

# The Apache Software Foundation is a non-profit organization  {#tax-status}

The Apache Software Foundation is a private operating foundation that is
registered as a non-profit, charitable organization under Section 501(c)(3)
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. This means that, for individuals within
the U.S., donations to the ASF should be **tax-deductible**. We are not
accountants, so this cannot be trusted as financial advice of any kind, but
hopefully this description will be useful to those who advise you in these
matters. You may view our [ruling letter from the IRS acknowledging our
501(c)3 status](records/ASF-501c3.pdf).

You may also review the latest financial filings and non-profit exemption
application of The Apache Software Foundation in our [public
records](records/) section. You may also find other helpful information
through
[GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/controller/searchResults.gs?action_gsReport=1&npoId=1166096)
(requires free registration for full access).

More information about non-profits and related issues can be found at the
[Internet Nonprofit Center](https://www.nonprofits.org/).

# Talk to someone about supporting the ASF!  {#Fundraising}

If you would like more information about supporting the ASF, please contact
*fundraising at apache dot org* for more information.

All information will be kept in strictest confidence.

# Become a Sponsor  {#Sponsorship}

If your organization wants to be formally recognized as a
[sponsor of the Foundation](/foundation/thanks.html),
the [Sponsorship Program](sponsorship.html) page is official avenue for
substantial, non-directed monetary contributions to the ASF.

# Donate By Check  {#SnailMail}

<p>Send a check or money order, payable to "The
Apache Software Foundation", (<b>donations only, please</b>) to
<center>
 <address>
  Apache Software Foundation<br />
  401 Edgewater Place, Suite 600<br />
  Wakefield MA 01880<br />
  USA
 </address>
</center>
  
Please include the name under which you wish the donation to be credited,
either your own or the third-party if it is a gift on behalf of someone
else, and an e-mail address to which we can acknowledge receipt. This
information will not be used for any other purpose. We will send a physical
receipt by normal mail for any donations of US $250 or more, provided you
include a return address.</p>

# Donate your old car via Car Program LLC  {#CarProgram}

Donate your used car, truck, boat or RV to the Apache Software Foundation
and we'll arrange to have it picked up free of charge. We accept most
vehicles that are located in the United States, even if they don't run.
Some restrictions may apply on older vehicles, though. It's easy and
convenient, and you may be eligible for a tax deduction as well!

**Why donate my vehicle?** It's much easier to donate your used vehicle
than it is to sell it yourself. And the tax savings might even be more than
what you would receive from a trade in. You'll be spared the ordeal of
selling your vehicle.

You can follow the directions and fill out our online [ASF Car Donation
Form](/foundation/docs/ASF_Donation_Form.pdf). The donation is handled
through [Car Program LLC](https://www.donateacar.com/). You may find their
[frequently asked questions](https://www.donateacar.com/faqs.php) helpful.
