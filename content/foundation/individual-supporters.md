# Support ASF: Individual Giving Programs

ASF’s open source software is used ubiquitously around the world. Individual Supporters enable the Apache Software Foundation to serve as the global home for hundreds of software projects, and to incubate the next-generation of open source innovations. We thank all current ASF Individual Supporters for their loyalty and contributions, and look forward to welcoming new donors as we continue to expand our community.

## FAQ
	
### *How will my donation be used?*<br>
As a US 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable organization, the ASF depends on a variety of funding sources to sustain its day-to-day activities. Tax-deductible contributions from corporations, foundations, and private individuals help offset day-to-day operating expenses that include Infrastructure services; Marketing and PR/AR; and Legal, Accounting, and Operational support.

We spend less than 10% of our annual budget on overhead. 75% of the ASF's US $1.5M annual budget supports running our critical infrastructure (mailing lists, code repositories, bug tracking systems, Web servers, continuous integration servers, bandwidth, electricity, cooling, administrative staff, and more) that keeps the Foundation and its projects functioning 24x7x365. The annual cost is less than US $5K per project.
