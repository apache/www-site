Title: How it works: Board Meetings
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0



The nine-member board of the Apache Software Foundation meets once a month,
via conference call. In between meetings, they conduct business in the
traditional Apache fashion, on a mailing list (board@apache.org). All PMC
Chairs are required to subscribe to the board@ mailing list, and other ASF Members
are welcome to subscribe if they wish.
