# {{title}}

The best way to contribute to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to get involved with
one of our many Apache project communities.  The  best way to ask general questions 
about community involvement is to read about [Community Development at Apache](http://community.apache.org/).

The ASF is made up of over [300 different projects](http://projects.apache.org/), with many 
new project submissions (or podlings) coming into the [Apache Incubator](http://incubator.apache.org/) every year. 
So no matter what kinds of technology or software you use, we most 
likely have an Apache project that you'll be interested in.

## Use Apache products and give us feedback

Using Apache products, asking (and sometimes answering) questions, reporting bugs
and making feature requests are critical contributions to the success of the Apache project community.
User feedback helps drive our projects and the technologies behind them.

-  [See a listing of all projects](http://projects.apache.org/) 

-  [Join Apache project mailing lists](mailinglists.html) 

-  [Download Apache software releases](/dyn/closer.cgi) 

-  [Report bugs and request features](http://issues.apache.org/) 

## Contribute to the community

Beyond simple user activities, it's great to see users becoming contributors 
by helping with the
development of Apache projects. This can mean getting involved with the
discussions on the development mailing lists, answering other users' questions,
providing patches for bug fixes or features, and helping to improve developer and end-user
documentation.

-  [Join project mailing lists](mailinglists.html) 

-  [Checkout the latest code](/dev/#svn) 

-  [Create bug/feature patches](http://issues.apache.org/) 

-  [Understand How It Works](how-it-works.html) and see other [notes for
contributors](/dev/#committers) 

## Become a committer

We love to see contributors showing commitment. Projects invite committed participants to become committers and help shape the future of a project. 

Apache is a meritocracy. Once someone has shown sufficient sustained 
commitment to a project by helping out and contributing work to it
(and the ASF), the project may vote to invite that person to become a committer.

How does one show commitment?

Get involved and **contribute** via the user and developer
email lists, Wiki and forums (if any); extend or improve the documentation; 
work on bugs listed in the issue tracker or submit code patches. Answering other users' 
questions is a great way to get started, as is suggesting patches or improvements 
to [Apache project websites](../dev/contributors.html#websites).

Note that becoming a committer is not just about submitting some patches;
it's also about helping out on the development and user discussion lists,
helping with documentation and the issue tracker, and showing long-term interest.
