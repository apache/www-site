## Powered By Apache Logos  {#poweredby}

“Powered By” logos can be used by the ASF community-at-large on websites, documentation, and other marketing materials.

Guidelines for the appropriate use of the “Powered By Apache” logos include:

*   The “Powered By Apache” circular banded logo may be used standalone with The ASF logo mark (denoting general use of an ASF project) or in combination with an official/authorized ASF Project logo.
*   The official/authorized Project logo may not be altered in any way other than removing/separating the name(s) where applicable as approved by the associated Project Management Committee.
*   The appropriate trademark symbol(s), such as ® or ™, associated with the project's logo must be included in the logo.
*   The logo's circular band format, font, and color must not be altered in any way.
*   The logo and/or its contents must not be rotated, animated, distorted, or otherwise altered, nor should it be used as a graphic element, background, or pattern.
*   The logo and/or its contents must not be translated or localized, nor should it have versioning numbers or other unauthorized words added to it.
*   The preferred background color for the logo is white, however, the logo may appear on colored, black, or image/photographic backgrounds providing the logo's legibility is not compromised.
*   The logo may be sized and produced in multiple file formats as required by the Project Management Committee, with a preferred minimum size of 80 pixels high in Web/online applications (where possible) to ensure legibility.
*   The logo may not, under any circumstances, be incorporated with a third party's company name, product name, or logo(s), or adopt marks and/or logos that are confusingly similar to or imply improper association with The Apache Software Foundation.
*   Third parties and programs are not allowed to use official Apache project logos and/or create alternate logos or identifying marks relating to any Apache project without written permission from the associated Project Management Committee and/or ASF Brand Management.
*   We have a [trademark use policy for the "Powered By" phrase][1]
