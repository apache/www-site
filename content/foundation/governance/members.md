# Members

The Membership of the Apache Software Foundation are those individuals 
elected to Membership in the corporation itself; they are eligible to 
elect new Members and to elect Directors to the Board.

[TOC]

## Organization  {#organization}

The ASF is a [membership corporation][1], so Members serve a similar role as 
shareholders do in publicly traded corporations. Members may propose new 
candidate members, may vote in new candidate elections and in board elections.

Members are not empowered to speak officially on behalf of the ASF as a whole, 
nor do they have any special rights to influence technical direction of any 
Apache projects that they do not participate in a committer or PMC member. While Members often volunteer and serve in many capacities both at the 
Foundation level and within various Apache projects, their only specific 
*organizational* rights are to vote in board and Member elections.

The Apache Incubator is special: any ASF Member may request to be added to the 
Incubator PMC without a vote. Within the Incubator PMC, members may serve as 
official mentors or champions to incoming podlings, as well as voting on 
Incubator policy and releases of podlings undergoing incubation. In this way, 
members work to mentor podling communities and guide them in the Apache Way, 
and eventually to graduation as a top level Apache project.

## Legal  {#legal}

Members act as shareholders of the corporation. Each Member has a 
single vote on electing directors to the board; similarly members may vote on 
new nominees to membership. Members are eligible to nominate new candidate 
members and to nominate individuals to the board.

Organizationally, members do not have specific standing within any Apache 
projects or Incubator podlings. However, most members are active as individuals 
within multiple Apache projects on their own technical or social merits, and 
once elected as a member often find more ways to get involved in more Apache 
projects.

While the board and relevant officers are directly responsible for providing 
oversight to the many Apache projects, members often work within many Apache 
projects to help ensure projects run smoothly and follow the Apache Way.

## Communication  {#communication}

The central place for member-focused announcements and discussions is the 
privately archived members@ mailing list. This is used for a wide variety of 
purposes: proposing and discussing new technical or policy ideas within 
the ASF, announcing marriages or births within members' families or other major 
social events, and sharing any formal announcements to the membership from the board or 
corporate officers.

By policy, members have the **right to inspect and review the archives of all 
mailing lists** at Apache. This policy is designed to ensure that every member 
can independently inspect all corporate operations, and the operations of all 
Apache projects. Thus members may, for example, review all private mailing lists
about internal legal affairs, fundraising, and security issues, as well as any 
private@ lists used by our Apache projects' PMCs.

While members may send messages to any private lists, they do not automatically 
receive any special merit in terms of influencing the technical direction of 
Apache projects. Merit in Apache projects is gained within each individual 
project community, and membership does not convey any other special privileges.

## Meetings  {#meetings}

The board holds an [Annual Members' Meeting][2] at least every 13 months, at which members elect a [new board of 
directors][3], and may vote on [new member candidates][4]. Meetings 
currently take place on a private IRC channel, as an alternative to a traditional 
conference call, where any reports are read and members may ask questions. The 
meeting has a ~48 hour recess for voting, and then reconvenes to announce results 
and complete the meeting: this lets members who may not be able to personally 
attend the first portion of the meeting attend the second half, and, more importantly, to 
conduct voting by email asynchronously, using our own secure voter tool
(Now become its own [Apache STeVe][5] project). Members who are 
unable to attend any of the 2 day meeting period may provide for another member 
to proxy their attendance and votes.

The board sometimes holds interim Special Members' Meetings between Annual 
Meetings, primarily to give members a chance to nominate and vote on new candidate members. Members also use Special and Annual meetings to raise 
questions or issues about Foundation operations - although members 
usually just raise questions to the board or to any ASF officer at any time 
over our usual mailing lists. Members and invited guests are welcome at all 
Members' meetings.

Given the distributed and volunteer nature of the ASF, the Foundation no longer holds official, in-person 
meetings of the Membership. Foundations and projects conduct all their business on normal email lists, although some of the lists are 
private. Members do often meet in small groups in person, although this is for 
social reasons, and often involves a meal or drinks. When the ASF's annual ApacheCon conference takes place in a physical location, rather than online, many members and committers 
traditionally attend and meet each other there.

## Merit  {#merit}

All members have the ability to nominate new individuals as candidates for 
membership. The amount and types of merit that existing members look for in 
Apache committers varies, but always includes some significant technical or 
other contribution to one or more of our projects, as well as a clear interest 
and understanding of the Apache Way. Potential members display these contributions and 
traits over a significant period of time, usually over a year or more of 
engagement in one or more Apache projects.

Note that it is not required to be a committer before being considered for 
membership. However, in the vast majority of cases any 
potentially worthy individual has already become a committer on some Apache 
project. At least two individuals have been elected as members without being 
committers first, in each case for non-coding contributions in mentoring on the 
Apache Way or for other organizational work.

Many newly elected members are surprised (pleasantly!) to be told they've been 
elected. Typically, being nominated and elected as a new member happen well after the nominee has a clear track record and a positive 
influence on Apache projects for some time; in hindsight, a frequent comment 
is "Isn't So-and-So a member already? They do such good work!". The Apache culture frowns on individuals 
asking to be made a member (or worse, insisting they should be elected!). In a perhaps counter-intuitive way, being considered 
for membership is something that requires real effort acting over a measurable 
time, but without making it obvious that you're seeking recognition.

Members approve candidates for membership by a simple majority vote (more yes'es than no's) 
at Annual or Special members' meetings. Members vote using custom 
voting software, with secret ballots.

Within the Membership, merit is equal; all members have an equal vote and 
ability to propose change within the ASF. Membership is a notably helpful factor 
in being considered for the board or in appointment to officer positions at the 
ASF, although the most important factor is demonstrated merit within the 
particular project or the ASF as a whole.

## Community  {#community}

The ability of members to influence the ASF is simultaneously major and 
immaterial. On one hand, members vote on new candidate members, and more 
importantly vote on the Board of Directors, which clearly affects strategic 
policies of the ASF. On the other hand, membership grants individuals no other 
special merit within any of our projects, and is not an official position within 
the legal corporation itself.

The perceived importance of membership is likewise a dichotomy. Many members are 
quite modest about their membership, and a frequently heard comment is that 
"Oh, they really deserve to be recognized more than I did". For many, being 
elected a member was not a goal or title they were pursuing; rather, 
they were naturally doing their own work (at an Apache project), and were then 
recognized for it. Many members list their affiliation on their resume (or 
LinkedIn, etc.); some do not.

Recognition of membership varies widely outside of the ASF: some software 
companies don't seem to care what the ASF is or what membership means; a few 
software companies strongly encourage their employees to become committers 
or members, and gaining one of those roles is a notable prestige bonus within 
those companies. Likewise, open source conferences frequently invite members or officers of the ASF to be speakers.

Members share the community of all other members, and often serve 
as bridges between the various Apache projects they are involved in. 
Many members also volunteer extra time to serve as mentors, both working with projects and communities within the ASF and mentoring 
others or speaking at conferences outside of it.

## Technical  {#technical}

The membership as a whole and individually does not provide technical direction 
for any Apache projects directly; every PMC is free to manage its technical 
direction independently. PMCs are the governing body for their project, and are 
expected to manage the project's technology in the best interest of the whole 
project community, independent of outside commercial influence.

This is similar to how the board does not set technical direction for projects: 
this is a key reflection of how the ASF is intentionally structured to provide 
maximum freedom to its projects. The board and the ASF membership are happy to 
provide a home to any software project communities that are willing to follow 
the Apache Way. The mission of the ASF is to provide software for the common 
good: we are happy to help like-minded communities to provide that software; are 
confident that communities will form around software that is useful; and 
understand that there are many different ways to effectively and collaboratively 
build software.

Nearly all members participate in a number of 
Apache projects as individuals, based on their merit within the specific 
projects. Simply being elected a Member does not confer any additional 
abilities in terms of other projects. Many members choose to serve as ambassadors 
of the Apache Way, and usually get involved in more projects as time goes on.
