# {{title}}

This Charter outlines the ASF Board's operating procedures to ensure the transparent and effective governance of the Foundation and its open-source communities.

## 1. Purpose

The [Board of Directors](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html) ("the Board”) of the **Apache Software Foundation** (“The ASF”) provides strategic leadership, legal stewardship, and fiduciary oversight of the Foundation in accordance with its mission: *to provide software for the public good* by supporting collaborative, community-driven open-source software projects.

This Charter (*could also be referred to as a guide*) outlines the roles, responsibilities, structure, and operational procedures of The Board in fulfilling its governance obligations. Where there is a conflict between this document and the ASF Bylaws, the ASF Bylaws have precedence.

The Board is committed to transparent and accountable governance, operating openly in accordance with [ASF’s values and mission](https://www.apache.org/foundation/) to serve the public good.

---

## 2. Authority

[The Board](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/board.html) derives its formal authority from the [**ASF Bylaws**](https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html), the [laws of the State of Delaware](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/index.html) as a corporation, and the Foundation’s status as a [501(c)(3) nonprofit public charity](https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/) under [U.S. tax law](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations). The Board acts in the service of the public interest as described in filings with the IRS. The Board members are personally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law and the **ASF Bylaws** for actions taken in good faith within the scope of their duties.
