At a high level, organizational governance at the Apache Software Foundation 
(ASF) is fairly simple: the Members elect a Board of Directors;
the Board appoints various officers and creates PMCs; 
the PMCs report periodically to the board, and most other officers 
report through the President, who reports for them to the board.

  - Existing Members nominate and elect new members periodically, and 
    annually nominate and elect nine Directors to the board.
    
  - The board appoints operational officers, and delegates responsibility for 
    specific policy or operational areas to each officer.  For
    example, the VP, Legal Affairs Committee is responsible for setting
    legal policy for the ASF and all Apache projects, and working with
    corporate counsel.

  - The board appoints executive officers, including a President, 
    Secretary, and Treasurer, who are responsible for specific 
    operations of the ASF.
    
  - Most [officers report directly to the President][1] on a monthly basis, and 
    the President reports an overall operational status to the board at each meeting.

  - The VP, Infra reports to the President, and provides high-level oversight of 
     the operations of the infrastructure team.  Within the team, a paid Infra Admin 
     helps manage daily operations and prioritize work with the 
     paid staff who maintain services all Apache projects use.

  - The board creates and updates Project Management Committees (PMCs). 
    In most cases, the board simply ratifies properly constructed
    requests from the Incubator (to graduate podlings to  TLPs), or from
    the PMCs themselves (to add or remove PMC members).  In each case,
    the relevant PMC has already voted to recommend the change to the
    board.

  - PMCs report directly to the board quarterly.  The board exercises
    organizational oversight of PMCs, ensuring that they are
    functioning as a healthy and meritocratic community, and that they
    are following Apache policies.  The board does **not** provide
    technical governance; that is handled within the PMC itself.
	
  - The Chair of each PMC is a Vice President of that project, and thus 
    is an officer of the ASF.  The [primary duty of the chair](/dev/pmc.html#chair) is to ensure 
    that the project's reports are complete and submitted to the board.
    
  - PMCs vote on software product releases.  This ensures that all
    source code releases are acts of the ASF itself, through its
    properly-governed PMC.
    
  - PMCs nominate and elect new committers to their project.  PMCs also
    nominate and vote on new PMC members, whom the PMC then recommends
    to the board for approval.

  - The Apache Incubator is a special (I)PMC: it's work is to mentor new podling 
     communities to help them learn the Apache Way.  After each podling votes 
     on their software releases, the IPMC members provide oversight and vote 
     on that podling's release process as well, to ensure the podling is progressing 
     towards becoming a full Apache project.

  - By policy, only individuals may serve as Members, committers, PMC 
    members or ASF officers.  This is one way that the ASF and 
    [Apache projects preserve their independence](http://community.apache.org/projectIndependence).
