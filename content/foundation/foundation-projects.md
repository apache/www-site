To support our hundreds of Apache software project communities, the Apache Software
Foundation has created several committees with a Foundation-wide scope
and each with their own specific part to play. These committees include:

-  [Infrastructure](#infrastructure) 

-  [Incubator](#incubator) 

-  [Attic](#attic) 

-  [Legal Affairs](#legal) 

-  [Security](#security) 

-  [Travel Assistance](#travel) 

-  [Community Development](#community) 

-  [Security](#security)

-  [Legal Affairs](#legal)

The ASF has also created a number of Vice President officer roles with a foundation wide-scope in specific policy areas:

-  [JCP](#jcp) 

-  [W3C Relations](#w3c) 

-  [Brand Management](#brand) 

-  [Fundraising](#fundraising) 

-  [Marketing and Publicity](#pr) 

-  [Finance](#finance) 

The [overview of the corporate governance of the ASF](governance/) explains the reporting 
structure and authority of these committees and officers.  Importantly, while 
many of these positions create ASF-wide policy, Apache project PMCs each 
report directly to the Board, not to any specific officer or committee.

A [full listing of ASF officers](/foundation/) is available.

# Infrastructure  {#infrastructure}

The ASF does not have offices or buildings, it's a virtual entity that
exists only on the internet. Its only physical existence is the technical
infrastructure that lets the ASF and its projects operate.

The ASF has an Infrastructure team that is responsible for the management
and day-to-day system administration and operation of the hardware and code
that runs the above services.

For more regarding the Infrastructure team and the Infrastructure President's Committee that governs it, see the [Infrastructure
webpage](/dev/infrastructure.html).

# Incubator  {#incubator}

The Incubator Project Management Committee is the entry path into ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. All code donations from
external organisations, and existing external projects wishing to join
Apache, enter through the Incubator.

The Apache Incubator has two primary goals:

- Ensure all donations are in accordance with ASF legal standards

- Develop new communities that adhere to the ASF's guiding principles

For more regarding the Apache Incubator, see the [Incubator
website](http://incubator.apache.org/).

# Attic  {#attic}

The *Apache Attic Project Management Committee* -- where discontinued, abandoned, and retired
codebases and projects are stored. The Attic preserves project and product information for
posterity, reference, and potential future re-activation, while keeping it
clearly distinct from active work.

For more regarding the Apache Attic, see the [Attic
website](https://attic.apache.org/).

# Travel Assistance  {#travel}

The *Travel Assistance Committee* -- exists to help those who would like
to attend face-to-face ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons.

For more regarding Apache Travel Assistance, see the [Travel
page](/travel/).

# Community Development  {#community}

The *Community Development Project Management Committee* -- helps newcomers
understand how the ASF works so they gain confidence to participate
more directly.

For more regarding Apache Community Development, see the [Community
site](http://community.apache.org/).

# _Conference Planning_  {#concom}

As of 2013, the Conference Planning committee has been dissolved, 
and various corporate officers and the Community Development group are now responsible for assisting with or approving the running of Apache-related events. 

For more regarding Apache conferences, see the [Conferences
page](conferences.html).

# Security  {#security}

The *Security President's Committee* -- responsible for handling potential
security holes in the software produced by the foundation that might impact
our users. Finders of problems contadct this committee before making any
problem report available to the public, to allow affected projects to
provide fixes in time for the report, thus reducing vulnerability to a
minimum.

For more regarding Apache Security, see the [Security page](/security/).

# Legal Affairs  {#legal}

The *Legal Affairs Committee* -- responsible for legal issues
associated with licensing and license compatibilities and for the revision
of the Apache Software License.  

For more information or questions, see the [Legal page](/legal/). 

# _VP, JCP  {#jcp}_

The *JCP officer* was responsible for liaison between the ASF and the
Java Community Process (the ASF was a member of the JCP Executive Committee).

As of February 2012 the ASF is no longer represented at the JCP.

For more regarding the ASF and the JCP, see our [JCP page](/jcp/).

# VP, W3C Relations  {#w3c}

The *W3C Relations officer* -- responsible for liaison between the ASF
and the World Wide Web Consortium.

# VP, Brand Management  {#brand}

other issues regarding management of the Apache brand on behalf of the
foundation.
