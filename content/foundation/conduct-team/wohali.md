## Code Of Conduct

Pulling from many sources, and with the support of the project, I assembled the Apache [CouchDB Code of Conduct](https://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html), the first CoC to be adopted by an ASF project. With minor modification, this policy is now the [Apache Software Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

The [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html) and [ASF](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html) Codes of Conduct lay out some very simple rules for participating in our communities. Here's my attempt at a brief distillation of them. You should read the entire Code of Conduct, though - it's not that long.

* __Be open__ - Project and support work happens in a public space, not a private one. Work with us in the open so we can help many at once.
* __Be empathetic__ - It's easy to get frustrated, especially in text. Remember a person is on the other side of the discussion from you. Assume good intentions and act in an empathetic fashion.
* __Be collaborative__ - Working with other people, not against them, to help us grow fastest. Build on top of their contributions.
* __Be inquisitive__ - Ask questions - there is no such thing as a stupid question. Answer questions responsively and helpfully.
* __Use words carefully__ - Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment is totally unacceptable. This is a violence, sexism, racism and discrimination-free place.
* __Be concise__ - Take the time to explain yourself succinctly. Use summaries if your explanation will be long.
* __Step down considerately__ - When it's time to leave the project, help others transition into your responsibilities. Remain respectful and do not misrepresent the project after you leave.
* __Be diverse__ - Welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Documentation, support, design, artwork and more are just as important as code. Honour diversity in all its forms.
