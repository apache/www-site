### Highlights: Pre-1999  {#early}

Brian Behlendorf started collecting patches to be applied to the
last version of the NCSA http server. The Apache Group, consisting of 8
individuals, traded patches on a mailing list set up for the purpose. In
**April of 1995** the first public release of Apache (version 0.6.2)
came out. Apache 1.0 released on **December 1, 1995**, and within a year surpassed
NCSA as the most-used web server.

Jim Jagielski (Secretary and EVP), Ben Laurie, Sameer Parekh, Randy
Terbush (Treasurer), and Dirk-Willem van Gulik. New Apache Jakarta
and XML Projects join the Apache HTTP Server Project. Board Committees on
ASF Conferences, Licenses, and Security are formed. Discussions
about ASF's role as an Open Source incubator address fostering new
technologies such as Cocoon. The ASF receives numerous industry awards,
