## Scope

The announce@apache.org mailing list is intended for announcements such as new releases and security announcements.
It is a shared list for all ASF projects, so it is important that any emails are written to be understood by
the general reader -- who may have no knowledge of a particular project.

## Subject line (announcements)

It is vital that the subject line accurately describes the email content.
Readers should not be expected to read the email to determine whether or not it may be relevant to them.

The following is a good example:

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache Example 3.11 released

The following does not give enough detail:

Subject: [ANNOUNCE] New version of our CLI tool

Note: announcement subjects should start with the prefix [ANNOUNCE] or perhaps [ANN].
There is no need to use [ANNOUNCEMENT] as that takes up space unnecessarily.

## Body Content (announcements)

The email content needs to be concise, but with sufficient detail that the reader does not have to
read further to decide whether it applies to them.

Remember that the readership may have no idea what your project is about, so the body should
include a brief description of the project/product.

It should also include basic info on why this release is important: are there any security
fixes, or significant changes/improvements.
If not, and it is just a mix of fixes and minor improvement, say so.
Do not include a detailed list of all changes.

Include a link to the detailed changes for this release.
Ideally that page should highlight any major changes and security fixes.

Include a link to the [download page](https://infra.apache.org/release-download-pages.html) where the reader can download the source package.

It is also useful to include a direct link to the project home page.
