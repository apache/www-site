### About The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)  {#about}

Incorporated in 1999, the all-volunteer Foundation oversees more than sixty-five
diverse Open Source projects, including Apache HTTP Server — the
world's most popular Web server software since its creation in 1994.

Evolving from the original eight developers (collectively known as "the
Apache Group") who contributed code enhancements to the NCSA daemon Web
server, The ASF today is a fully-distributed, non-profit organization
comprising over {{asf_members_rounded}} individual Members and {{asf_committers_rounded}} Committers
across six continents.

The ASF's successful
[collaborative, meritocratic technology and
community development process](/foundation/how-it-works.html#history)
known as "The Apache Way" is both highly-emulated by other Open Source
initiatives and the subject of numerous industry case studies and
business school curricula.

The Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for
the incubation and development of enterprise-grade, freely available
software products, and minimizes the potential legal exposure of
intellectual property and financial contributions. The ASF's popular
Apache License makes it easy for all users to deploy Apache products:
by allowing source code to be used for the development of any software
– both Open Source and proprietary. Thousands of non-ASF-developed
software applications have been distributed under the terms of the
Apache License.

ApacheCon, The ASF's official user conference, trainings, and expo, draws
attendees from the Open Source community for unparalleled educational,
networking, hacking, and social opportunities. The conference and
related events are typically held several times each year, with
locations alternating between North America, Europe, and Asia. More
information can be found on the
[ApacheCon site](http://www.apachecon.com/).

### Interview and Analyst Briefing Requests  {#interviews}

Lauded as one of the most compelling communities in Open Source, The
Apache Software Foundation frequently works with members of the
media and industry analysts as experts on a broad range of
technology, development, and community issues. We are happy to
serve as a resource to editors and analysts; provide quotes from
ASF executives and Project Management Committee members; review
upcoming articles for accuracy of Apache-related facts; and provide
industry insight to select organizations.

Kindly note that The ASF is vendor-neutral: we are unable to provide any
statements that endorse, promote, or advertise the capability,
credibility, or quality of any technology, product, or service.
Please
[contact us](mailto:press@apache.org?subject=[Press%20request]%20Briefing%20requests)
for assistance.

### Press Release Review Process  {#releases}

Any press release or news announcement that refers to The ASF and/or
its projects must be reviewed and approved by the VP, Marketing and Publicity 
or the Apache Press Team in
advance of its distribution. Our review/approval process requires
a minimum two weeks (10 business days) to review for general
content and to ensure messaging accuracy within the announcement
and supporting documents fall within our guidelines. We are
sensitive to internal approval processes and will expedite
feedback where possible. **IMPORTANT:** kindly notify us if you plan
to distribute your announcement in advance to the media (or hold
briefings) under embargo.

Please forward the document in its entirety (even if in draft stage) to
[press@apache.org](mailto:press@apache.org?subject=[Review]%20Please%20review%20this%20press%20release)
for consideration. Note that The ASF is
vendor-neutral and does not provide any testimonials that
endorse, promote, or advertise the capability, credibility, or
quality of any technology, product, or service. If seeking a
quote from The ASF, please supply a quote that we can review and
modify: we will confirm the appropriateness of the quote, along
with the correct spokesperson for attribution. We will not
participate in announcements that contain any statements that we
perceive to be disparaging, inflammatory, or harmful.

**ASF Joint Announcements:** rarely issued; examples of such
releases include instances where a major industry milestone or
initiative takes place, or announcing
[ASF Platinum-level Sponsorships](/foundation/sponsorship.html).
Sample Headlines might include: "ASF Reaches Agreement with Sun Microsystems
to Allow Open Source Java Implementations", or "Company X
Announces ASF Platinum Sponsorship". Kindly contact the Apache Press Team
directly at [press@apache.org](mailto:press@apache.org?subject=[Review]%20Please%20review%20this%20joint%20release) for guidelines pertaining to
headline/lead, dateline, and boilerplate use. If seeking a quote
from The ASF, please supply a quote that we can review and
modify: note that The ASF is vendor-neutral and does not provide
any testimonials that endorse, promote, or advertise the
capability, credibility, or quality of any technology, product,
or service. We will confirm the appropriateness of the quote,
along with the correct spokesperson for attribution.

**ASF-Supporting Announcements:** the following applies to those
directly involved with The ASF, for example, a company whose
employees actively participate in the development of an ASF
project, or products are based on ASF projects, or has become a
new ASF Sponsor. Sample headlines might include: "Company X Applauds the
Release of Apache ProjectName v.1.5", or "Company X Supports
Apache ProjectName with Product". The announcement may state that
employees or consultants participate in the development of an ASF
project, or serve The ASF on a Project Management Committee (PMC)
or executive level position. Such an individual may provide a
quote in the press release, but cannot imply that the statement
is on behalf of The ASF unless prior permission has been granted
and the proposed quote approved by the VP, Marketing and Publicity 
or the Apache Press Team. 

Another such release
would be a general industry announcement: for example, a report
on Open Source development practices or research findings that
featured
The ASF, its projects, or The Apache Way. Sample headlines might include:
"Government Study Finds New Technology Development Methods
Strongly Influenced by Open Source Best Practices". A
vendor-neutral industry-related statement or quote may be
provided by The ASF *only* with prior permission; the overall
announcement content and proposed quote must be approved by the
VP, Marketing and Publicity 
or the Apache Press Team. The announcement must not include The ASF boilerplate,
dateline location, logo, media contacts (including agencies
acting on behalf of the ASF) may not be used in such
announcements; additionally, The ASF cannot be an active lead in
the headline or lead.

**Third Party Announcements:** applies to those indirectly involved
with The ASF, for example: a company whose products and services
are based on Apache-developed projects (where the Apache project
is an "ingredient brand"), or announcing conference speakers or
special events (such as a user group meetings and trainings).
SAMPLE headlines: "Company X CEO to Deliver Keynote at
ApacheCon", or "CompanyName to hold Apache ProjectName User Group
Meeting/Training/etc.", or "CompanyName Launches Product Powered
by Apache ProjectName".

The ASF is vendor-neutral and does not provide any testimonials that
endorse, promote, or advertise the capability, credibility, or
quality of any technology, product, or service. A quote cannot be
provided by The ASF, *except under very rare circumstances* with
the overall announcement and proposed quote approved by the VP, Marketing and Publicity 
or the Apache Press Team.
The announcement must not include The ASF boilerplate, dateline
location, logo, media contacts (including agencies acting on
behalf of The ASF). In addition, The ASF cannot be an active lead
in the headline, nor can the announcement state that the third
party is in partnership with or jointly announces to do something
together with The ASF.
