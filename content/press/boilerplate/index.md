Title: Press Release Boilerplates
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) maintains a number of boilerplates, 
or short paragraphs describing the ASF for use in releases or announcements of various kinds.

**Note:** Formal press releases (i.e. distributed through newswires)
made by the ASF, or jointly made with another organization must be 
approved by the [VP, Marketing and Publicity][M&P] 
before release, and must include the press release boilerplate below.
Third parties may **not** use the ASF boilerplate in releases without 
explicit permission.

### Press Release Boilerplate ###

Formal press releases on behalf of the ASF must use the long form 
of the press release boilerplate below, unless there is a specific 
reason to use the short form.

### Project Release Or General Announcement Boilerplate ###

Project release announcements or other general public announcements 
made by any ASF PMC should use the general boilerplate 
below as a way to show consistency and community across the various 
projects at the ASF.  Append this as part of the footer of any 
major email announcements made.
