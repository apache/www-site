# Stories of past Travel Assistance Recipients #

[TOC]

The Travel Assistance Committee exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons.

Over the years, quite a number of different people, from all backgrounds
and from all over the world, have been helped by TAC to attend Apache 
events. This is a collection of some of their stories.
