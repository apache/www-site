**What's your name?**

 Andriy Redko

**What Apache project are you involved in?**

 Apache CXF

**Where in the world are you from?**

 Canada

**What was the best bit about ApacheCon?**

For me ApacheCon is all about community. I met so many great people, have a lot of 
thoughtful conversations, heard about dozens of very interesting projects I had no
idea existed. It is a terrific event. 

**What was the best new project you heard about at ApacheCon?**

 The last ApacheCon brought Apache HTrace to my attention. This is very interesting
 project in the niche of distributed tracing, and I was desperately looking for such
 a solution to build off Apache CXF features on top of it. 

**What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?**

I liked very much the "Introduction into Apache Kafka" talk, it was very well
delivered and accepted.

**How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?**

By all means, ApacheCon was possible for me only because of TAC. I was not be able to make
it without assistance. I am very grateful TAC for picking me and giving me a chance to 
be a part of ApacheCon, this experience is worth repeating and I am looking for ways to
make it this year.
