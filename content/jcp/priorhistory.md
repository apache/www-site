# Apache And The Java Community Process #

The Apache Software Foundation has been a participant in the [Java
Community Process](http://www.jcp.org/) since the creation of "JCP 2.0".
Apache holds a seat on the [Executive Committee for
J2SE/J2EE.](http://www.jcp.org/en/participation/committee) 

Apache is focused on promoting the ideals of community collaboration and
transparency and has been working for many years with demonstrable success.
Apache was a key participant in the JCP 2.5 process change that allows for
open-source implementations of JCP specifications and that grants free TCK
licenses to qualified-non-profits, individuals and academics. Apache is a
member of the TCK scholarship committee along with Doug Lea and Sun.

Our goal is to put the "Community" in Java Community Process.

The JCP activities of the ASF are centered around three areas :

- Implementation of JCP specifications, such as [Apache
Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) , [Apache
Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org/) ,
[WebServices](http://ws.apache.org/) ,
[Portlets](http://portals.apache.org/) , [Apache
MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org/) and many others.

- Participation in multiple expert groups of the JCP via individuals
representing the ASF.

- Influence the evolution of the JCP through our participation on the
Executive Committee.

# Getting Involved #

## 1) Mail Lists  {#MailLists}

There are two general mail lists for the JCP activities at the ASF :

- ASF JCP Public Interest List (open to all committers)
[subscribe](mailto:jcp-open-subscribe@apache.org) 

- Foundation Internal JCP Issues (members-only)
[subscribe](mailto:jcp-subscribe@apache.org) 

Expert group interest lists can be created as need and interest dictates.

## 2) Representation  {#Representation}

Apache community members represent the ASF on various expert groups. Our
goal is to bring our interests in openness, meritocracy and community to
the expert groups we work on. We encourage expert groups to:

- Operate in an open, transparent manner in the same way that our Apache
community lists work

- Use consensus and/or voting for decision making

- License their specifications to allow royalty-free implementations under
an open source license

- License their Reference Implementations (RIs) and Technology
Compatibility Kits (TCKs) under open source licenses

### Representing the ASF on a JSR  {#RepsOnJSRs}

Members and committers are invited to represent the ASF on JSRs with the
purpose of both promoting our values as well as ensuring that the Apache
community can continue to influence and participate in the creation of new
Java technology. Because participating individuals are representing the
Apache Software Foundation (and not themselves), the ASF reserves the right
to decide who represents the ASF. The ASF also will work to help
individuals join expert groups, as we believe that independent
representatives that have a good understanding of the value of open source
are important to the health of the JCP communities.

The general guidelines for participation are:

- You represent the interests of the ASF and your particular technical
community, and not of your employer or personal technological interests

- If there is an existing community at the ASF that has an interest in the
JSR, engage with your community to bring feedback and ideas to the EG. If
not, keep in mind how an ASF community might build or extend such a
specification

If you are interested in representing the ASF on a new or existing expert
group that doesn't have ASF representation, or participating with the
existing activities on an expert group, please [send email to the JCP open
list](mailto:jcp-open@apache.org?Subject=Interest%20in%20Participation) and
indicate your interest.

### Current Representation  {#CurrentReps}

The following JSRs have active Apache representation. Some groups have an
internal mailing list that is used by ASF Members and committers to discuss
the progress of the JSR and the ASF's involvement through its
representative(s). The list operates under the [rules above for
representatives](#RepsOnJSRs).

|  JSR  |  Representative  |  Discussion List  |

### Implementation  {#tck}

Because of the work of the ASF, we are able to legally implement JSRs in
open source and distribute under the terms of the [Apache
License](/licenses/). There have been many successful
implementations of JSRs at the ASF, in all areas of Java technology.

Projects are free to implement whatever JSR a project community desires, as
long the specification license that you agree to allows open source
implementations. All modern JSRs do - the key to knowing is to look to see
that the JSR was conducted under "JCP version" 2.5 or above. There are some
exceptions, such as [J2SE 5](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=176) which
was conducted under JCP v 2.1 yet licensed under the modern
open-source-friendly specification license.

The following projects are implementing one or more JCP specifications:

|  Project  |  JSR  |
|-----------|-------|
|  [Apache Geronimo 1.x](http://geronimo.apache.org/)  | J2EE 1.4 |
|  [Apache Geronimo 2.x](http://geronimo.apache.org/)  | Java EE 5 |
|  [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)  | Servlet and JSP |
|  [Apache DB](http://db.apache.org/)  | JDO 2 (in JDO) |
|  [Apache Jakarta](http://jakarta.apache.org/)  | JSTL (in Taglibs) |
|  [Apache MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org/)  | JSF |
|  [Apache Portals](http://portals.apache.org/)  | Portlets (in Pluto) |
|  [Apache WebServices](http://ws.apache.org/)  | JAX-RPC, JAXB, J2ME WS, JAXM, JAXR, SAAJ |
|  [Apache Jackrabbit](http://jackrabbit.apache.org/)  | Content Repository (JSR-170, JSR-283) |
|  [Apache OpenJPA (Incubator)](http://incubator.apache.org/openjpa)  | Java Peristence API (JSR-220) |
|  [Apache Harmony](http://harmony.apache.org/)  | Java SE 5 (JSR-176) |
|  [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/)  | JAX-WS (JSR-224), JAX-RS (JSR-311) |

The following projects have officially tested and passed the TCK for their
specific technology:

|  Project  |  Version  |  JSR  |  Date  |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
|  [Apache Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org/)  | 1.0 | J2EE 1.4 | 2006-01-05 |
|  [Apache Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org/)  | 2.1 | Java EE 5 | 2008-02-15 |
|  [Apache MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org/)  | 1.1.8 | JSF 1.1 | 2010-06-10 |
| 1.2.9 | JSF 1.2 | 2010-06-10 |
| 2.0.2 | JSF 2.0 | 2010-09-25 |
|  [Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/)  | 2.0/2.1 | JAX-WS 2.0/2.1 | 2007-06-19 |
| 2.2.2 | JAX-RS 1.0 | 2009-05-28 |
| 2.3.0 | JAX-RS 1.1/JAX-WS 2.2 | 2010-10-11 |

### Testing with A TCK  {#gettingtck}

Whenever a project chooses, it may request access to the TCK for the
technology they are implementing. The ASF will work to license, acquire and
provide the TCK for the project. The following guidelines apply to working
with TCKs at the ASF:

- A project can request access to a TCK by sending email to [the JCP open
list](mailto:jcp-open@apache.org?Subject=Need%20TCK%20for%20Apache%20Project). 

- This TCK is for use * **only** * for the purpose of the Apache project,
and no other.

- While access to the TCK is left up to the requesting PMC, it is
*strongly* encouraged that access be limited to project committers to avoid
the perception that the ASF is being used as a "TCK laundry". We have an
excellent record in our handling of the TCK materials, and the good
reputation of the ASF is dependent upon PMC oversight in this case.

- Every individual that has access to the TCK materials *must* have
executed a [Non-Disclosure Agreement](ApacheNDA.pdf) with the ASF. The ASF
receives these materials under the terms of an NDA, and we must take due
care in how we handle these materials.

Traditionally, projects using Apache's TCKs have been very strict and
closed about what information could be discussed in public forums. Over the
years, this approach has been gradually relaxed by some projects with no
adverse affects on the community, the general TCK testing process, or the
ASF's commitment to protect the confidential information entrusted to it.

Therefore, the following should be deemed the guiding policy for dealing
with TCKs from the ASF :

> *Projects must keep the official TCK materials confidential. Use your
> best judgement. For the elimination of doubt, public discussion about
> using the TCK, bugs found while using the TCK, and any project-created
> frameworks or assisting software or documentation that do not reveal the
> official confidential TCK material is acceptable.* 

If there are any questions about this policy, please send mail to the
[jcp-open@apache.org](mailto:jcp-open-subscribe@apache.org) list or mail
[the VP, JCP privately](mailto:geirm@apache.org).

Also note :

> *The Apache Software Foundation has reconsidered its policy of allowing
> software used for general community work to be covered under an agreement
> such as the NDA. The general plan is to eliminate NDAs for project
> software in a way that minimizes the distruption to our communities. We
> will work with organizations such as the JCP and its spec leads to
> achieve an acceptable resolution. While a hard date has not be officially
> set, we're looking for complete elimination of the NDA for project
> software by 2010. Discussion of this issue in the context of the JCP and
> the TCKs will take place on the
> [jcp-open@apache.org](mailto:jcp-open-subscribe@apache.org) list.*
