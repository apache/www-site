Title: Always free
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0



Apache software is always available for download free of charge from the ASF and our Apache projects.

As a non-profit corporation whose mission is to provide open source software for the public good at no cost, the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) ensures that 
all Apache projects provide both source and (when available) binary releases free of charge on our official Apache project download pages. 
Our corporate bylaws explicitly state that Apache projects create ["open-source" software for distribution to the public at no charge][7]. 

Apache projects will never charge a fee for downloading or using their software.  

## Is Apache software really free to download?

Yes.  Over {{pmc_count_rounded}} Apache projects and {{podlings_size}} podlings provide software products that may be 
downloaded and used at no cost, including everything from the world-famous 
[Apache HTTP Server][1], to [Apache Hadoop][2], to [Apache Lucene][3], 
to [Apache OpenOffice][4], and many, many more.

## May I use Apache software for any purpose?

Yes.  Apache projects always release source code under the [Apache License][5], a 
pragmatic and permissive license that provides broad freedoms for 
users of our software.  You can use the software for just about anything, whether you 
use the product itself, or modify the source code to change 
functionality or to create new software products.  The primary restriction in the license is 
protecting Apache trademarks: you generally may not use Apache trademarks or brands for 
your own software; that use is reserved to the ASF and Apache projects.

You can [read about the Apache License](/licenses/) for details, and 
learn more about the [Legal Affairs Committee](/legal/) if you have questions.

## Is Apache software open source?

Yes.  The Apache License meets both the Open Source Initiative's (OSI) 
[Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd), and the 
Free Software Foundation's [definition of "free software"](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#apache2).

These definitions ensure that the Apache license provides certain key freedoms to users of Apache 
software in terms of what you as a user may do with or use Apache source code or software

## Why do some websites charge money for Apache software?

The Apache License does not prohibit other organizations from selling Apache software.  They may provide a useful 
service for certain users, for example by distributing software on a CD-ROM or a USB data stick.  However, in most cases it's just as simple (and always free)
to download the Apache software directly from the appropriate Apache project.

## What should I do when I find a website that charges for Apache software?

In most cases, you can simply remember that Apache source code is always 
available free of charge directly from the appropriate Apache project.  If 
you see a non-Apache.org website that is confusingly similar to the Apache 
brand, or leads consumers to believe that it is an official Apache website,
check the [Apache Trademark Policy](/foundation/marks/) for our contact details and let us know about the site.

Note that many other organizations sell their **own branded** software products 
that may include or be integrated with Apache software; our license permits this type of use.  Similarly, many other organizations sell 
consulting, training, or other services or hosting related to Apache software.
As long as these organizations aren't confusing users into believing the 
services or products are coming from Apache, they're generally okay.

## Where can I learn more about Apache projects?

The ASF provides a [list of all Apache projects][6] and most Apache software 
products available.  The best way to learn more about an Apache project is to ask 
questions on the [project's own email list](/foundation/getinvolved.html).
Email lists at Apache are also free for anyone to use; we archive them publicly so you can search them for message threads of interest.
