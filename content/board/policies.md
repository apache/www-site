Title: Apache Board -- Project Services & Expectations


# {{title}}

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) provides a wide array of 
**services** to the many Apache communities and their Project Management 
Committees (PMCs) that we host in line with our 
[vision of independent, volunteer-run projects](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-2018).  
The Board of Directors and [relevant ASF officers](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/orgchart) also set various 
required **policies** and best practices that our PMCs are expected to follow.
