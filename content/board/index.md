### Welcome from the ASF Board of Directors!

The [board of directors](https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/) provides strategic oversight for all operations at the ASF.
While our many Apache projects are run by volunteers working together on a consensus model,
as a corporation there are some areas that are run by the board, relevant corporate officers, or paid staff/contractors of the ASF.
These /board/ pages serve as an official home any statements or offerings from the Board itself, on behalf of the ASF.

The board is happy to host:
* [Listing of core requirements for Apache projects](/board/policies)
* [Listing of core ASF services provided to Apache projects](/board/services)
* [Five-year Strategic Plan for the Apache Software Foundation<](/board/plan)
* [Guide To Escalating Issues at the ASF](/board/escalation)
