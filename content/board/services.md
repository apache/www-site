Title: Foundation Services for Apache Projects

Slug: services

# {{title}}

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) provides a wide array of 
services to the [many Apache communities](https://projects.apache.org/) and their Project Management 
Committees (PMCs) that the ASF hosts in line with our 
[vision of independent, volunteer-run projects](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-2018).  

## Services Available To Apache Projects

The ASF provides the following services to all PMCs through a combination of 
self-organized volunteer groups and some paid services & contractors. 
Some services are officially supported and offer service level agreements
(SLA) like our website, mailing lists, and source code hosting by the 
Apache Infrastructure team.  Other services are offered by volunteer 
officers of the ASF and and organized groups of volunteers, like 
the Community Development PMC.

The best place to ask questions about any services is by contacting the 
group managing that service using the appropriate mailing list.  Note that while much of the work 
the ASF does is in public, the ASF only *supports* these services for 
**Apache projects** doing their work.  Other communities are welcome to fork our code 
or documentation, but the ASF cannot provide services for other projects.
