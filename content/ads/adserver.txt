NOTE: This method has been replaced by the process documented at https://apachecon.com/event-images/

Apache websites SHOULD include images so that the ConCom or PRC can advertise
ApacheCon or other events.

Maybe we'll expand the use of this later after probably a very extensive
discussion somewhere. For now, we won't.

Ok, basics.

Button/banner standard sizes:

  468x60  full banner (not yet implemented)
  234x60  half banner
  125x125 button

The files (e.g. buttonbar.html) are html fragments to produce a <div> with two
images below each other inside. You can use CSS to customize appearance.

Howto
-----

* Option 1: Use an <iframe>:

  Here is an example for dual button images in a left-hand navigation panel:

<iframe title="Apache Events" src="https://www.apache.org/ads/buttonbar.html"
    style="border-width:0; float: left" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"
    width="135" height="265"></iframe>

The style parameter may be adjusted as needed.  The width and height need to be
exact, so don't forget to sum your margins, padding, borders, etc. for the CSS
design of the rest of your page.

* Option 2: Use hard-coded plain html fragment:

Some web applications will not be able to use the iframe method, but can
directly use the html fragment from buttonbar.html for example. However this
circumvents the adserver, so make sure that you keep up-to-date.

When are these updated
----------------------
Should be done by concom only.

When the confirmed dates and locations are known, a standard 125x125 image
and a 234x60 image are generated and added to the directory ads/ApacheCon/
See the readme.

Entries are added to the Calendar, e.g. people.apache.org/calendar.html#20075

When the producer-maintained conference websites are ready, the apachecon.com
re-directs are configured, e.g. apachecon.com/2007/EU/ and eu.apachecon.com etc.
If a conference site is not yet ready, then refer to the ASF Calendar.

Please do not advertise conferences too far in advance. We need to keep focus
on the current upcoming conferences.

Updating the banners
--------------------
Should be done by concom only. Just edit the HTML files. You can test locally
by saving any website page that has them and replacing the stuff between

  <!-- ads start -->

  <!-- ads end -->

with the new file.
