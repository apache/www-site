# Henry Story, 1967-07-29 - â€ 2023-09-05

Henry Story passed away, rather suddenly, in September 2023.

Over the past 30 years, he made many contributions to the standards of
the World Wide Web on a wide range of standards; from Atom to
LinkedData to WebID and many other semantic- and big-data work.

Always trying to keep the web open, fair and neutral. Labouring to
keep the web, and its technology, available for anyone. Requiring
as little as a smart inquisitive individual devoting time. And without
having to enter into license agreements, pass toll-gates or becoming
a member of some walled gardens. Latterly he was the chair of  the W3C
WebID Expert Group on the Apache Software Foundations behalf. Here he
was instrumental in keeping some of the early standards open and
specifically designed to be as resistant as possible for capture by
platforms, browsers and other fiefdoms.

I will personally also remember him for the many little surprise
emails. In which he generously explained complex concepts. Or where
his he shared insights, or mapped out unintended, but real,
consequences arising from the interaction between standards, society
and economics. Often adding his lovely philosophical touch that lifted
you up, with positivity, hope and helped you see things in perspective.
