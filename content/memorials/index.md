# {{title}}

It is an unfortunate truth that, at times, any community will lose valued
members. This site is a means to rejoice in them and their
contributions to our community, and to keep their memory alive.

Everyone listed here is remembered by the Apache community 
that they worked with.

We hope that this site will help give family and friends who have
not participated in Apache Software Foundation projects some insight
into the work that their loved ones have been doing here, and also a flavor
of the relationships that they developed with their colleagues at
Apache.
