It is with great sadness that we must report the staggering loss of our
good friend and colleague, Maurice Marrink. Maurice died in a car crash
in 2008.

Maurice was a dear co-worker, project member and good friend. He was always
enthusiastic, willing to lend a hand and above all friendly. Coming from
the northern parts of the Netherlands, Maurice could be quite stubborn at
times-–a trait that is invaluable in as a software engineer,
especially when working in a group of strong-minded people.

Maurice was a great asset to the Wicket community since Wicket became open
source. The Wicket team was fortunate to have Maurice on board. He was committed to the continued success of Wicket and the Apache
community as a whole.

Maurice has guided students who created the initial Wicket Dojo
integration (Wicket 1.1 timeframe, before Wicket Ajax). He put a lot of
effort into creating two security frameworks for Wicket, with the latest
and greatest open sourced: the Wicket Security framework (aka Swarm/Wasp).
He had many good ideas on the future of Wicket and integrating his projects
into our core distribution.

Within Topicus he was one of the pillars of our company–professionally and, even more importantly, culturally. He was always organizing and attending
social events, nerd nights, cart challenges and board gaming evenings. Just weeks before his death he was our hero when he arranged tickets for a pre-screening
of _Batman: The dark knight_ at our local IMax theatre.

Maurice, we miss you. All our thoughts and good wishes are with you and
your loved ones. May your soul find peace.
