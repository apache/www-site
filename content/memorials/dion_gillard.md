**from Brett Porter:**

When I was learning to get involved at Apache, Dion was particularly
encouraging to me. He was the first guy I met in person from Maven and
Apache since he organised the Sydney Java User Group that I started
attending around the same time I became a committer.

He was the first chair of Maven when it became a TLP, and did a significant
amount of work on Maven 1.0. Even after having moved on from Maven more
than three years ago, he remains the fourth-largest code contributor to the
project, and we wouldn't have come this far without his efforts.

A genuinely good bloke, he will be greatly missed.

**from Rahul Akolkar:**

Dion's exemplary work at the ASF has touched, and will continue to touch,
numerous people and products. Having worked with Dion on one
project, I was always impressed by his technical vision and
ability to welcome and mentor new contributors. Dion was one of the kindest
souls around -- I remember his "we're lucky to have you" personal email
when I became an ASF member, and many other occasions when he was
similarly and extraordinarily supportive and gracious. He will be sorely
missed.

**from Paul Libbrecht**

Dion was a very dynamic committer... together we shared the fun of Apache Jelly
and tried to shape its rubbery aspects.

Dion's initiatives were always striving for quality and I really appreciated
working with him.

The announcement of him demise is a shock for me. We'll miss him.
