Title: Nicolas Chalumeau: a Memorial
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0



Our friend Nicolas Chalumeau has departed this world on the 4th of October
2005, at the age of 27.

The Apache Software Foundation would like to express its condolences to
Nicolas' family and friends.

Nicolas had been developing open source software at Apache for several
years. He was participating in several projects, including Jakarta Cactus
and Apache Maven. But even more importantly than helping those projects,
what made Nicolas stand apart was his kindness and his generosity. He was
always open to discussion and was constantly helping others. On the Cactus
project he was regularly the first to answer questions from newcomers
trying to use Cactus.

Recently he had taken up the important task of helping migrate Cactus to
use Cargo and he had been working diligently towards that goal. Actually
Nicolas had been doing such a great job on the Cactus project that the
Cactus committers had unanimously voted him in to become a committer.
Nicolas was voted an Apache committer on the 1st of August, 2005. I had
several discussions with Nicolas about this new role and he was extremely
happy to be part of the Apache Foundation.

Nicolas, we'll miss you, but the work you have done for the community will
be remembered forever and will live on. All our thoughts and good wishes
are with you and your loved ones.

*- Vincent, on behalf of the Apache community*
