On September 30th, 2016 Apache Tiles' former PMC chair Gregory David 
(Greg) Reddin passed away. Greg joined the Struts team in October 
2005 and started working on Tiles and, in particular, on the hard 
work of refactoring and extracting Tiles from Struts.

Thanks to Greg's efforts, the Tiles top level project has been 
established in January 2007 with Greg becoming the obvious PMC chair.

Now Greg's idea of "Standalone Tiles" is widely used and accepted 
worldwide and supported by third party software like Spring. His work 
and his vision are still present in the foundation of the code and his 
contribution is invaluable. We, as the Apache Tiles community, express 
our condolences to the wife and children. Be proud of him as we are 
thankful for his work.

***What people had to say about Greg ...***
<br>
<br>

> "I met Greg in 2006 when he was working on the extraction of Tiles 
from Struts. On one patch after the other, he let me jump on board for the 
The Great Rework of Tiles. Greg started it and made the major work, 
while I and David DeWolf were working on improving some aspects. Greg 
gave me several lessons of good programming as I was only a junior 
developer at the time. When Tiles became a TLP, Greg became a great 
PMC chair. Although he was no more involved in the active development 
of Tiles, Greg was always taking care of the evolution of the project 
and he was always kind to me and to users of Tiles who wrote in the 
mailing list. I will miss you a lot, Greg."

> "Greg also served as a mentor for Apache Flex, helping us learn how to 
operate as an Apache project, and even stayed around after we became a 
full-fledged project to offer advice.  I never  met Greg in person, but 
I am thankful for the opportunity to have learned from him."

> "I didn't know Greg very well, but indeed he was the Chair of the 
project when I joined and always the guy who bent over backwards to 
help us should we merely ask. He will be missed. Sincere condolences 
go to his wife, children and family."
