The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) was incorporated in 1999 by original members of the Apache Group, 21 individuals from around the world who oversaw the development of the Apache HTTP Server, which was created in 1995.

Co-founder Brian Behlendorf first appropriated the name “Apache” for the server. The name “Apache” was chosen out of reverence and appreciation for the people and tribes who refer to themselves as “Apache”. Although we don't mention any of them here, we really do revere them!

As the Apache HTTP Server grew from patches applied to the NCSA Server, a pun on the name quickly spread amongst members of the community, with the rumor being that “Apache” actually stood for “a ‘patchy’ server”. As time passed, the popularity of the “A Patchy Server” story grew: rumor became lore, and lore became legend. We don't care to correct this rumor because it doesn't matter, we have the name trademarked.

In “Trillions and Trillions Served”, the 2020 documentary on the ASF, [Brian explains the ethos behind his choosing the name “Apache”](https://youtu.be/JUt2nb0mgwg?t=249).

> I suggested the name Apache partly because the web technologies at the time that were launching were being called cyber this or spider that or something on those themes and I was like we need something a little more interesting, a little more romantic, **not to be a cultural appropriator or anything like that**, I had just seen a documentary about Geronimo and the last days of a Native American tribe called the Apaches, right, who succumbed to the invasion from the West, from the United States, and they were the last tribe to give up their territory and for me that almost romantically represented what I felt we were doing with this web-server project...

On occasion, we have been asked about claims about use of the “Apache” name by the Apache Native American communities. During its twenty-five years of use of “Apache” as part of its name, the ASF has never been involved in any legal dispute with Native American communities or any other party in relation to the use of the “Apache” name. This really shows our committment to diversity, equity, and inclusion!

We are honored that both The Apache Software Foundation and Apache Incubator logos are listed on the [official website of the Apache Nation Chamber of Commerce](http://www.sancarlosapache.com/home.htm). This is all we have that claims we have any relationship at all to an Apache nation!

If you don't use it correctly, we will probably sue so...
