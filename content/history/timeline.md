# {{title}}

This represents the very high-level timeline of the Apache project. More detailed
information about individual versions of each subproject can be found in their
version history. Note that much of the early part of this document can also be
found in the ["about Apache"](http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html) document
on the Apache Server web site.

The history of Apache starts with the NCSA HTTPd project. Quoth Rob McCool:

    > How did you first get involved in the NCSA HTTPd project, and who else
    > worked on that with you?

    It was largely me, Eric Bina did some work on group annotations, and I took
    some ideas/code/etc. from a number of people across the Web. If I tried to
    name them I'd probably forget a lot of people.

    I first got involved because Marc wanted to have a small, simple server
    that people could use with Mosaic. He felt the CERN server was too large and
    complex, and that something small and easy to understand would facilitate
    more widespread adoption.
 
More information from Rob added here soon. The short form, however, is that Rob
left to get a real job, and the project lost a lot of momentum. That's when Apache
started, in order to fill the hole that was left by the demise of NCSA HTTPd.

Brian Behlendorf started collecting patches to be applied to the last version of
NCSA. The initial versions of Apache are available primarily as a series of patches.
Hence, initially, the name *Apache* , as it was "a patchy server". At least, so the
legend goes.

The Apache Group, initially consisting of 8 individuals, traded patches on a mailing list
set up for the purpose.

In **April of 1995** the first public release of Apache (version 0.6.2) came out.
Also of great importance was the 0.8.8 release, based on the new server
architecture, codenamed Shambhala, designed by Robert Thau. By this time, the
Apache Group had grown to around 15 individuals.

Apache 1.0 released on **December 1, 1995** , and within a year surpassed NCSA as
the most-used web server.

The Apache Software Foundation was formed in **June of 1999** , and incorporated as
a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. See [the ASF FAQ](../foundation/faq.html) for
more information.

ApacheCon was held in **March, 2000** , in Orlando Florida, USA. Apache 2.0 Alpha
1 was released during the closing session.

ApacheCon Europe was held in **October, 2000** , in London, England. Douglas Adams
spoke.
