This page provides detailed information on the export control status of the
Apache Software Foundation's [products](#matrix), and pointers to
the open-source code from which those products are built.

ASF projects and PMCs should consult our [guide to handling
cryptography](/dev/crypto.html) in order to comply with our export
policies.

# Exporting ASF Products  {#exporting}

[The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](/foundation/)
is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity based in the United States of America. All
of our products are developed via online collaboration in public forums and
distributed from a central server within the U.S. Therefore, U.S. export
laws and regulations apply to our distributions and remain in force as
products and technology are re-exported to different parties and places
around the world. Information on export control classifications and
associated restrictions may be required for exporting, re-exporting, record
keeping, bundling/embedding of ASF products, encryption reporting, and
shipping documentation. You can find more information on U.S. Export Regulations at [http://www.bis.doc.gov/](http://www.bis.doc.gov/).

The [Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)](http://bxa.doc.gov/), a branch
of the U.S. Department of Commerce, regulates exports through the [Export
Administration Regulations
(EAR)](http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html). The regulations
describe export rules and restrictions on a wide range of commodities,
technologies, and software. This document is no substitute for
understanding those regulations; the ASF cannot anticipate how they might
apply to third party distributions or for specific export decisions made by
those parties. End-user, end-use and country of ultimate destination may
affect export licensing requirements.

The [ASF Product Classification Matrix](#matrix) is a general listing of
ASF software products and their source links for which we have determined
an export classification for that product as distributed by the Apache
Software Foundation. Use the matrix in conjunction with the EAR
to provide classification information to assist exporters in the
export of ASF products and to provide guidance to BIS employees who seek
the source code for ASF products. All export classification information
contained in the matrix is subject to change without notice.

## Embargoed Destinations  {#embargoed}

You may **not** export or reexport, either directly or indirectly, ASF software and/or technical data to any destination subject to U.S. embargoes or
trade sanctions, unless formally authorized by the U.S. Government. Note
that the list of embargoed destinations is subject to change and the scope of
what technology is included in the embargo is specific to each embargoed
country. For the most current information on U.S. embargoed and sanctioned
countries, see the U.S. [Export Administration
Regulations](http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/index.html) and [Treasury
Department regulations](http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/).

## Denied Parties Lists  {#denied}

U.S. export regulations require that all international and domestic
transactions be screened against the U.S. Government listing of prohibited
end users. Shipments to certain individuals, organizations, or institutions
who have violated U.S. export laws are prohibited. The United States
government maintains [export prohibited
lists](http://www.bis.doc.gov/ComplianceAndEnforcement/ListsToCheck.htm) ,
including but not limited to the [Treasury Department's Specially
Designated Nationals
List](http://www.treas.gov/offices/eotffc/ofac/sdn/index.html) and
[Commerce Department's Entity and Denied Persons
Lists](http://bxa.doc.gov/dpl/Default.shtm).

# ASF Product Classification Matrix  {#matrix}

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) makes NO WARRANTY or representation
that the information contained in the ASF Product Classification Matrix is
accurate, current, or complete. It is your obligation as the exporter to
comply with the current applicable requirements of United States export
rules and regulations. Any use of such information by you is without
recourse to the ASF and is at your own risk. The ASF is in no way
responsible for any damages, whether direct, consequential, incidental, or
otherwise, that you suffer as a result of using or relying upon such
information for any purpose.

Each ASF product is
[classified](http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm) with an
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) if it is believed to correspond
to an entry in the Commerce Control List (CCL) and subject to the EAR. All
ASF software is published in a publicly available source code form. Since
software classified as ECCN 5d002 or 5D992 is [subject to the 
EAR](http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/txt/734.txt), all ASF
software product versions that do not fit those two classifications are
noted as ECCN "Not determined" or not included in the matrix.

The ASF exports products classified as [ECCN
5D002](http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/txt/ccl5-pt2.txt) under the publicly-available exemption found in EAR Section 742.15(b),
which applies to software containing or designed for use with encryption software 
that is publicly available as open source. Note that exporters other than the
ASF within the U.S. may or may not be eligible for the publicly-available exemption 
in section 742.15(b), and it is each specific exporter's responsibility to understand 
and comply with all export regulations applicable within their jurisdiction.
