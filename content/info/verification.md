# How to verify downloaded files  {#how-to-verify}

This page describes how to verify a file, downloaded from a mirror,
by [checksum](#CheckingHashes) or by [signature](#CheckingSignatures).

All official releases of code distributed by the Apache Software Foundation
are signed by the release manager for the release.
PGP signatures and SHA/MD5 checksums are available along with the distribution.

You are encouraged to download the releases from our mirrors.
Signatures and checksums are only available from
the official Apache Software Foundation site.
<br>
Our download pages point you to the mirrors for releases and
to the official site for signatures and checksums.

## Checking Hashes  {#CheckingHashes}
File hashes are used to check that a file has been downloaded correctly.
They do not provide any guarantees as to the authenticity of the file.

The *checksum* of a file is a fixed length string, that (in practice)
uniquely identifies the *contents* of the file.
Two files are (only) equal if their checksums are equal.
Comparing the checksums of two files is as good as comparing the two files
themselves.

There are lots of checksum algorithms ; we use SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 and MD5.
<br>
The download page shows which checksum files
are available for the *original* file.

To check a hash, you have to *compute* the proper checksum of the file
you just downloaded ;
then *compare* it with the published checksum of the *original*.

<style type="text/css">
td  { padding : 5px ; font-family : monospace ; font-size : smaller }

</style>
<blockquote>

  <td>sha1sum <i>file</i></td>
  <td>shasum -a 1 <i>file</i></td>
  <td><i>file</i>.sha1</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>SHA-256</th><td>certUtil -hashfile <i>file</i> SHA256</td>
  <td>sha256sum <i>file</i></td>
  <td>shasum -a 256 <i>file</i></td>
  <td><i>file</i>.sha256</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>SHA-512</th><td>certUtil -hashfile <i>file</i> SHA512</td>
  <td>sha512sum <i>file</i></td>
  <td>shasum -a 512 <i>file</i></td>
  <td><i>file</i>.sha512</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>MD5</th><td>certUtil -hashfile <i>file</i> MD5</td>
  <td>md5sum <i>file</i></td>
  <td>md5 <i>file</i></td>
  <td><i>file</i>.md5</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Only if you check the hash can you be certain that your download
hasn't been modified ; for instance on the mirror - or the download
itself may be incomplete or faulty.

## Checking Signatures  {#CheckingSignatures}
The following example details how signature interaction works. The example
is for the Apache HTTP Server project, but applies equally to other ASF
projects.

In this example, you are already assumed to have downloaded
`httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz` (the release) and `httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz.asc` (the
detached signature).

This example uses [The GNU Privacy Guard](http://www.gnupg.org/). Any
[OpenPGP](http://www.openpgp.org/)-compliant program should work
successfully.

First, we will check the detached signature (`httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz.asc`)
against our release (`httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz`).

**<a name="specify_both"></a>N.B. you must specify both the detached signature and the release file.**
<br>If the release file is omitted, GPG will only check the signature against the release file if the signature is a detached signature.
If the .asc file is a self-contained signed file, GPG will only check that, and will not verify the release.
(This should not happen if the signature file was downloaded from an ASF server, but it is safer to always specify the release filename)

    % gpg --verify httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz.asc httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz
    gpg: Signature made Sat Jan 18 07:21:28 2003 PST using DSA key ID DE885DD3
    gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found

This means that we don't have the release manager's public key (`DE885DD3`)
in our local system. You now need to retrieve the public key from a key
server. One popular server is `pgpkeys.mit.edu` (which has a [web
interface](http://pgp.mit.edu/) ). The public key servers are linked
together, so you should be able to connect to any key server.

    % gpg --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu --recv-key DE885DD3
    gpg: requesting key DE885DD3 from HKP keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu
    gpg: trustdb created
    gpg: key DE885DD3: public key "Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 1
    gpg:               imported: 1

In this example, you have now received a public key for an entity known as
`Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>`. However, you have no way of
verifying this key was created by the person known as Sander Striker. But,
let's try to verify the release signature again.

    % gpg --verify httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz.asc httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz
    gpg: Signature made Sat Jan 18 07:21:28 2003 PST using DSA key ID DE885DD3
    gpg: Good signature from "Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>"
    gpg:                 aka "Sander Striker <striker@striker.nl>"
    gpg: checking the trustdb
    gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Fingerprint: 4C1E ADAD B4EF 5007 579C  919C 6635 B6C0 DE88 5DD3

At this point, the signature is good, but we don't trust this key. A good
signature means that the file has not been tampered with. However, due to
the nature of public key cryptography, you need to additionally verify that
key `DE885DD3` was created by the **real** Sander Striker.

Any attacker can create a public key and upload it to the public key
servers. They can then create a malicious release signed by this fake key.
Then, if you tried to verify the signature of this corrupt release, it
would succeed because the key was not the 'real' key. Therefore, you need
to validate the authenticity of this key.

#### Validating Authenticity of a Key  {#Validating}
You may download public keys for the Apache project developers from our
website or retrieve them from the public PGP keyservers (see above).
However, importing these keys is not enough to verify the integrity of the
signatures. If a release verifies as good, you need to validate that the
key was created by an official representative of the Apache HTTP Server
Project.

The crucial step to validation is to confirm the key fingerprint of the
public key.

    % gpg --fingerprint DE885DD3
    pub  1024D/DE885DD3 2002-04-10 Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>
         Key fingerprint = 4C1E ADAD B4EF 5007 579C  919C 6635 B6C0 DE88 5DD3
    uid                 Sander Striker <striker@striker.nl>
    sub  2048g/532D14CA 2002-04-10

A good start to validating a key is by face-to-face communication with
multiple government-issued photo identification confirmations. However,
each person is free to have their own standards for determining the
authenticity of a key. Some people are satisfied by reading the key
signature over a telephone (voice verification). For more information on
determining what level of trust works best for you, please read the GNU
Privacy Handbook section on [Validating other keys on your public
keyring](http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN335).

Most of the Apache HTTP Server developers have attempted to sign each
others' keys (usually with face-to-face validation). Therefore, in order to
enter the web of trust, you should only need to validate one person in our
web of trust. (Hint: all of our developers' keys are in the KEYS file.)

For example, the following people have signed the public key for Sander
Striker. If you verify any key on this list, you will have a trust path to
the `DE885DD3` key. If you verify a key that verifies one of the signatories
for `DE885DD3`, then you will have a trust path. (So on, and so on.)

Since the developers are usually quite busy, you may not immediately find
success in someone who is willing to meet face-to-face (they may not even
respond to your emails because they are so busy!). If you do not have a
developer nearby or have trouble locating a suitable person, please send an
email to the address of the key you are attempting to verify. They may be
able to find someone who will be willing to validate their key or arrange
alternate mechanisms for validation.

Once you have entered the web of trust, you should see the following upon
verifying the signature of a release.

    % gpg --verify httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz.asc httpd-2.0.44.tar.gz
    gpg: Signature made Sat Jan 18 07:21:28 2003 PST using DSA key ID DE885DD3
    gpg: Good signature from "Sander Striker <striker@apache.org>"
    gpg:                 aka "Sander Striker <striker@striker.nl>"
